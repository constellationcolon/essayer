      Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its interests
      and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens,
      ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp.

      Yet curiously enough, though he knew that he needed help, he was slow to
      call in the social scientist. The chemist, the physicist, the geologist,
      had a much earlier and more friendly reception. Laboratories were set up
      for them, inducements offered, for there was quick appreciation of the
      victories over nature. But the scientist who has human nature as his
      problem is in a different case. There are many reasons for this: the
      chief one, that he has so few victories to exhibit. He has so few,
      because unless he deals with the historic past, he cannot prove his
      theories before offering them to the public. The physical scientist can
      make an hypothesis, test it, revise the hypothesis hundreds of times,
      and, if after all that, he is wrong, no one else has to pay the price.
      But the social scientist cannot begin to offer the assurance of a
      laboratory test, and if his advice is followed, and he is wrong, the
      consequences may be incalculable. He is in the nature of things far more
      responsible, and far less certain.
