  <h1>Pourquoi essayer?</h1>
  <div class="main-text">
    <p id="paragraph-0">Or as the English may have it, “Why Try?”</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">They tell you, when you read Montaigne’s <em>Essais</em>, that “essayer” means “to
attempt”, or “to test” in its native French.<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-1" class="sidenote">Disclaimer: am not
French. It is possible that this is so obvious that they <em>don’t</em> bother
telling you that when you read it as a French person.</span> The
<em>essay</em>, then a freshly minted format in the Western canon, was meant to be a
piece of writing primarily for exploring ideas, rather than for the sake of
argument, or for the sake of exposition.</p>

<p id="paragraph-2">400 years after Montaigne, git was born<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-2" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-2" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-2" class="sidenote"><span class="small-caps">TIL</span> this
fortuitous event took place as recently as 2005. Now 15 years later I am
committing this to digital memory via a company that does nothing <em>but</em> git.
Yes, I know that <span class="small-caps">SVN</span> et al existed before that, but you’re also
reading this on GitHub, not SVNHub.</span>, and with it, gave us a
whole new way of writing, collaborating, and blaming other people for bad code
only to find out definitively that it was your own damned self from one year
ago all along.</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">And in some ways, those are the exact purposes of written discourse—to assert,
to exchange ideas, and to blame others for logical fallacies all up until the
point that you discover you’d laid those mental traps for yourself in the first
place. It’s a medium for extraversion and introspection alike.</p>

<p class="section-break" id="paragraph-4">&amp;</p>

<p id="paragraph-5">There’s this article, years gone, that still comes to mind. I can’t remember
what it was called, or what its subject was,<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-3" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-3" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-3" class="sidenote">If you, dear reader,
do remember such a thing floating around the internet, please do point me to
it, will you?</span> but I do remember that it was presented as if
it were a word document on edit mode, laying bare every word misspelled and
then corrected, every paragraph typed up and subsequently discarded, even
whole themes developed and subsequently abandoned on the way to producing the
final opus. Kill your darlings indeed. Kill them dead.</p>

<p id="paragraph-6">In that particular incarnation, the article turned out to be a beast to read,
with all its green fields of newly sprouted words, its boundless grey oceans
of stricken-out text in between the solid black shorelines of black type that’d
made the final cut. But the idea stuck, that even (especially?) those that
write for a living will only get the words to come out right on a second,
third, or even a hundredth try—whittling down the verbiage, sharpening up the
propositions each time they revisit it.</p>

<p id="paragraph-7">Not very far apart, I’ve found, from what I do in my day job. In code, what
writers call “editing”, we call “refactoring”: rebuilding our instructions for
the machines little by little as we learn about the problems we’re trying to
solve through the very process of solving them. Tidying up the plot, so to
speak. Trimming the fat, but keeping the scraps, just in case they come in
useful later on. Also helpful for being honest with yourself: human
endeavours are never borne of immaculate conception.</p>
