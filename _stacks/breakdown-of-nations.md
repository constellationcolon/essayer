A classic book, with wide-ranging implications for how we structure our
communities and societies. Its conclusions have held up remarkably well over
the years, and continues to be incredibly relevant to our current state of
over-extended affairs (e.g. <span class='small-caps'>US</span> imperialism,
Brexit, climate change, tech anti-trust, etc. etc.). It upended my thinking on
the uses of "unity" and "size" for purposes of peace (cf [Wars & Unions]({%
link _zettel/202102030550-wars-and-unions.md %})).

If you were looking for solutions to the problems of scale, Kohr does suggest
a few. If you were looking for optimism about the fate of the human race,
however, I'd strongly suggest you look elsewhere (though that does not prevent
me from recommending it, so endearing is his expression of nihilism).

## Unkastened Notes

I find it a little ironic that a book about how "smaller nations are better"
opens with this grand claim that he's going to propose herein one single
social model to rule them all. I suppose even he couldn't help but get caught
up in the hard-science envy of the day.

So much Orientalism on page 9:

>  It is the face of Michelangelo we see in Saint Peter's Basilica, not that of
>  the Italian people which put the marble in its place. This is the main
>  difference from the massive accumulations of stone built in Egypt not by

Also some uses of "mongoloid" as an adjective + questionable stances on
feminism, hence my content warning.

What's the "half-life" of an over-large society?

### "Producer goods"

Large-scale manufacturing gives us "producer goods" e.g. factories "which
satisfy no direct human want but have become necessary in order to enable us
to meet our increasing requirements for essentials." {% cite

### Size theory of business cycles

p. 147

- **Power commodities** "tanks, bombs, or the increase in government services
  required to administer increased power."
- **Density commodities** "traffic lights, first-aid equipment, tube services,
  or replacement goods for losses which would never have occurred in less
  harassed smaller societies."
- **Progress commodities** arms race conditions: anti-aircraft guns must be
  improved to match improved aircraft and so on, "*unwanted* tie-in products
  we must acquire along with the desired fruit of progress".

### (How) Can it be done, the breakdown of nations?

1. war
1. proportional representation in a federal union (oh boy... population wars)
1. appeal to particularist sentiments (e.g. Brexit, Scottish/Basque/Catalan
  independence, etc.)

### Chapter Eleven: BUT WILL IT BE DONE?

> NO!
