## Notes

I find it a little ironic that a book about how "smaller nations are better"
opens with this grand claim that he's going to propose herein one single
social model to rule them all. I suppose even he couldn't help but get caught
up in the hard-science envy of the day.

### Size theory of business cycles

p. 147

**Power commodities** "tanks, bombs, or the increase in government services required to administer increased power."

**Density commodities** "traffic lights, first-aid equipment, tube services,
or replacement goods for losses which would never have occurred in less
harassed smaller societies."

**Progress commodities** arms race conditions: anti-aircraft guns must be
improved to match improved aircraft and so on, "*unwanted* tie-in products we
must acquire along with the desired fruit of progress".

### Successful vs unsuccessful federations

Successful federations have "enforceable executive authority" (p. 177)
1. federal must be slightly stronger than its strongest member
1. members relatively homogeneous in size
    - else the strongest members will refuse to contribute to federal organ
      that can overshadow themselves
    - smaller member states must be able to stand together against the bigger

> {% marginnote %}{% cite breakdown-of-nations -L page -l 174 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> And the small member states could not conceivably make up for the deficiency
> of the big. Hence the pathetic emphasis of large-power unions such as the
> United Nations or the European Council on good will. But good will has no
> executive authority, and without executive authority no political organism
> can exist. As a result, large-power unions are able to live only by the
> grace of their large members who can, and do, veto them out of existence at
> will.

> As a result, if we are interested in creating international unions not only
> effectively but also economically, peacefully, and democratically, we must

### (How) Can it be done, the breakdown of nations?

1. war
1. proportional representation in a federal union (oh boy... population wars)
1. appeal to particularist sentiments (e.g. Brexit, Scottish/Basque/Catalan
  independence, etc.)

### Chapter Eleven: BUT WILL IT BE DONE?

> NO!

BRB DYING

### Questions

1.  Assuming small is indeed beautiful, how are we to effectively work against
    the expansionary tendencies of our contemporary ideology? How does one
    stand against monopolistic practices, against consolidation, against
    over-size in corporations, organisations, nations?

    (Discussed in chap. 10)

1.  It seems like what Kohr is prescribing here is to have 
    federations made up of members of roughly equal size—but this seems a
    rather utopic argument that ignores the inherent boundary conditions
    imposed on state formation by geography (e.g. bioregions). Switzerland
    being cited as an example of a successful union—is that really all up to
    the sizes of its cantons, or has it something to do too with it being the
    ("anarchic") uplands of its surrounding valley states?

1.  One of the premises of the EU is that such a regional union fosters
    cooperation and peace, truce in contrast to their bloody history. Yet
    there are detractors from such oversized unions (ahem, *Brexit*)—of which
    this book is possibly one, who claim that on the contrary, it is the
    mega-unions waging wars eternal. Is it possible to keep the peace without
    having to resort to hegemony?

    (The Kohr argument: there are going to be wars anyway. Let them get it
    out, don't stand in their way, but keep them as skirmishes between piddly
    parties rather than gargantuan wars between superpowers that suck in the
    entirety of humankind.)
