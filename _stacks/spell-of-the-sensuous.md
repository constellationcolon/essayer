# On Language

Greeks: humans are apart from animals, men are apart from women & children
=> justification for special place in society & the world. (i.e. justification
for exploitation and domination)

Darwin: humans aren't that special, we're descended from apes.
=> Human language as replacement justification, emphasis on abstract formalisms
of language rather than the metaphorical nature of utterances.
