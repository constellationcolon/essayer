> individual executions or burials not only become cumbersome but technically
> unfeasible. So new practices have to be initiated. Now the victims are led

Illich used to wave off people fundraising for some distant cause or another,
saying "I don't care". This is despite—or perhaps because of—all the work he'd
done as a priest with South American communities. He insists he doesn't care,
because he recognises his limits as a human being, and that to really _care_
about someone hurting far off requires him to drop all he's doing, and rush
immediately to their side to care for those people. To pay undue attention to
far-off suffering is to blind ourselves to the people right in front of us, in
our immediate vicinity, who may be suffering just the same (he had a much
better way of putting this) [{% cite illich-in-conversation %}]
