## Ultra-processed foods

[Nova: a categorisation of foods by processing degree][ultra-processed]

> What characterises ultra-processed foods is that they are so altered that it
> can be hard to recognise the underlying ingredients. These are concoctions of
> concoctions, engineered from ingredients that are already highly refined,
> such as cheap vegetable oils, flours, whey proteins and sugars, which are
> then whipped up into something more appetising with the help of industrial
> additives such as emulsifiers.
