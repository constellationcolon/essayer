As a Singaporean living in the States, I am often given to ponder the cultural
differences between the two countries.

The popular account of the East-West divide is that of collectivism vs.
individualism, actively propagated by both poles of the world in asserting
their regional identities. (cf LKY statements on "Singapore exceptionalism",
or almost any piece of mainstream reporting from a Western outlet on an
Eastern country)

Lived experience in the States, however, has often given me pause as to what
extent people actually _practice_ individualism, all rhetoric aside. I have
found its corporations just as hierarchical, its citizens just as prone to
bootlicking and mass delusions, just as willing to submit themselves to
becoming excellent sheep [{% cite excellent-sheep %}] as the finest
kiasu/kiasi in Singapore.

An unfortunate proportion of Americans still like to believe that their
individual enterprise will guarantee them individual gain, when their efforts
feed more into the capitalist system, for the benefit of a few wealthy
individuals at the top of the food chain, than ever before. Singaporeans
harbour no such delusions. Fortunately for us, decades of inundation by
Western media narratives have kept us on guard and skeptical about the claims
of our state-owned media. There's a saying, that to genuinely know what's
happening in your own country, you need only to look to the reports in the
foreign press. [Many Americans could stand to benefit from such a
practice.][us-covid-roast]

Kohr believes that the tendency towards collectivism boils down to the *scale*
of a society, regardless of its particular brand of professed ideology.
(Quotes follow) This is an intriguing possibility, and certainly jives with
anthropological studies on state formation and function. I do not believe,
however, that the inverse holds: that is to say, one cannot automatically
assume that small state => individualistic/democratic. If anything,
totalitarian control comes even more easily to hand. [Just ask LKY.]({% link

But all this worship of the masses, the people, the nation, and of the
institutions representing them, is collectivism under whatever name it goes.
And collectivism is irreconcilable with the ideals of democracy which, like
Western civilization, is inseparably linked with individualism. It is
logical nonsense to accuse the Marxists of collectivist thinking because
they place society above man, and then proclaim ourselves that the nation
stands above the individual.

Submissiveness is thus not a human quality that could be explained to a
significant extent as the result of upbringing, tradition, national
character, or the mode of production. Like most other social attitudes, it
is the adaptive reflex reaction with which man responds to power. Its degree
varies directly with the degree of power, just as its opposite reaction, the
assertion of freedom, varies inversely with it. Where there is power, there
is submission, and where there is no submission, there is no power. This is
why, historically, the seemingly most freedom-loving peoples have accepted
tyranny as submissively as the seemingly most submissive ones, or why it
is safe to say that even Americans would submit if our federal structure
permitted the accumulation of the necessary volume of governmental power.

But even this will not make us look very different if we realize that
communism is not the only the *natural* system of huge organisms, but the
*only* system by which they can maintain themselves. Hugeness, as we have
seen, needs conscious direction, supervision, control, obedience,
conformity, efficiency, standardization, discipline, alikeness in habit and
thought, unity, centralism—all concepts which in their sum constitute the
essence and operating basis of socialism. Our empire being as huge as
Russia’s, and requiring the same continuous state of preparedness, will need
as much centralization and direction and, though we may call our brand
anti-communism or, perhaps, the mood of the age, it will be communism just
the same. Thus, a time will come when the two halves of the world, organized
along such different roads, will be identical in everything but their name.
And the reason for it will be the same which is responsible for the fact
that the only thing looking exactly like the North Pole is its very
opposite—the South Pole. And this will be the end of the process of
consolidation.

Kohr on US being a "successful" federation because of its relatively weak
states compared to authority of DC. The inter-state and inter-national nature
of its corporations have forced the US to become a "large-scale" society
anyway. Temporally speaking, the same thing: only the president has term
limits, corporations face little/no effective limits on size or power.

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
But not in all her relationships is the United States a small-state complex,
and where it is not, we see a repetition of the same problems of size which
are typical of all large-area or large-power organizations. Thus, private
economic power, unlike the political power of the states, is not limited by
state boundaries. As a result, we find that a number of economic powers and
enterprises have been organized on a large-scale, coast-to-coast, basis.
This means that each of them is in a position to throw the entire nation,
not just a single state, off its balance if mood or ambition should counsel
such a course.
