Consider the model of words and concepts as vectors (e.g. word2vec).

A curious phenomenon in which a vector enters the basis set itself.

In which a goal, fixed at a certain point in space, morphs into an axis,
defined by the infinite positive, in opposition to its infinite negative.

The inversion of effability (vectors) and ineffability (axes).

The transformation of means into ends. [{% cite tools-for-conviviality %}]

## Transformation of Quantity into Quality

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">

This condition must by necessity produce a fundamental change in the outlook
of the citizen of the mass state. Finding himself perpetually living in the
midst of formidable crowds it is only natural that he should begin to see
greatness in what to the inhabitant of a small state is a stifling nightmare.
He becomes obsessed with a mass complex. He becomes number struck and cheers
whenever another million is added to the population figure. He falls into
the error against which Aristotle has warned, and confounds a populous state
with a great one. Quantity suddenly turns before his dazzled eyes into
quality.
