  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
Man the individual, the active, is replaced in mass states by man the type,
the passive. Nothing illustrates more tellingly this transformation than
our increasing preference for the passive voice in our speech. We no longer
fly to London. With a touch of pride we now say that we are flown there by
the government or an air line. We no longer eat, but are fed. We are housed,
entertained, schooled, evacuated, and taken care of in many important
respects by mother government and father state. Previously we allowed
ourselves to be treated as passives only as babies, invalids, or corpses.
Now we are treated in this manner all our lives and, instead of resenting
it, actually demand it.
