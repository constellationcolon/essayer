## Votation != Representation

## Brave New World

Factory-bred, graded babies, reared by the state.

Adults occupied by soma, employment, not reproduction, or bringing up the
next generation as their own.

Future, or past and present?

## A world arranged around ~~adults~~ productive units

School start times arranged so that parents can dispose of their children at
school before going to work, despite research showing that youth perform better
at school when school starts later in the day.

School re-openings during COVID-19. Adults stay at home to work, while
children still get bundled off to school with other children—so that they
don't get in the way of the adults being productive. What a way to show young
people how much society values their health or well-being as compared to GDP!
