## From Lippmann

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">


In order to do so it is necessary at the outset to reduce the ambiguity of
the term "the people." For it has two different meanings, which it may be
convenient to distinguish typographically. When we speak of popular sovereignty, we must know whether we are talking about The People, as voters, or about *The People*, as a community of the entire living population, with their predecessors and successors.

It is often assumed, but without warrant, that the opinions of The People
as voters can be treated as the expression of the interests of *The
People* as an historic community. The crucial problem of modern democracy
arises from the fact that this assumption is false. The voters cannot be
relied upon to represent *The People*. The opinions of voters in elections
are not to be accepted unquestioningly as true judgments of the vital
interests of the community.

[...]

The inhabitants of the United States who were qualified to vote for these
delegates were not a large number. They included no slaves, no women and,
except in New York, only such adult males as could pass property and other
highly restrictive tests. [...]

Because of the discrepancy between The People as voters and *The People*
as the corporate nation, the voters have no title to consider themselves
the proprietors of the commonwealth and to claim that their interests are
identical with the public interest. A prevailing plurality of the voters
are not *The People*. The claim that they are is a bogus title invoked to
justify the usurpation of the executive power by representative assemblies
and the intimidation of public men by demagogic politicians. In fact
demagoguery can be described as the sleight of hand by which a faction of
The People as voters are invested with the authority of *The People*. That
is why so many crimes are committed in the people's name.

[...]

The people, then, is not only, as Bentham assumed, the aggregate of living
persons. The people is also the stream of individuals, the connected
generations of changing persons, that Burke was talking about when he
invoked the partnership "not only between those who are living" but also
with "those who are dead, and those who are to be born." *The People* are a
corporation, an entity, that is to say, which lives on while individuals
come into it and go out of it.

## Brave New World

Factory-bred, graded babies, reared by the state.

Adults occupied by soma, employment, not reproduction, or bringing up the
next generation as their own.

Future, or past and present?

## A world around ~~adults~~ productive units

School start times arranged so that parents can dispose of their children at
school before going to work, despite research showing that youth perform better
at school when school starts later in the day.

School re-openings during COVID-19. Adults stay at home to work, while
children still get bundled off to school with other children—so that they
don't get in the way of the adults being productive. What a way to show young
people how much society values their health or well-being as compared to GDP!

## Intergenerational theft

College tuition as debt bondage. Environmental extraction, exploitation, and
degradation.

## "Filial Piety"

Why should a child show filial piety?

Why should I be grateful for my parents' or a state's supposed benevolence in
bringing me into the world and up into adulthood when I had no say in the
matter of whether I wanted to exist in the first place? By what evidence can
the authorities say that such an existence is desirable?

What is filial piety, in the final equation, but one generation saddling the
next with the noose of debt they had inherited from the generation prior?
In agricultural societies (or at the very least, in East Asian society), one
has children so as to have "people to take care of them in their old age".
What a glib way of saying, let me bring a person into this world, enslave them
in debt by raising them to adulthood, so that they will serve me in the future!

In hunter-gatherer societies, the norm is that the old get left behind at some
point, when they aren't as spry.

What is human nature? What part of it consists of state fabrications?
