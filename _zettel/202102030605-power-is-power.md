<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
Since great power is by definition an element that can single-handedly throw
the world from its balance, a single dictator in a large state is sufficient
to disturb the peace of mind of all. As a result, a great-power world is
safe and secure only if the government of each great power is in the hands
of wise and good men (a combination that is rare even in democracies). As
things are, however, great power attracts by its very nature the strong
rather than the wise, and autocrats rather than democrats.
