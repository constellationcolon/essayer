Many of our inventions seem to beget more "externalities" than improve our
lives. What would it take for us to focus our sights on appropriate
technologiesâ€”tools that work _with_ us instead of _for_ us so as to raise our
standards of living, instead of inventing more tools for novelty's sake (as
is the imperative of capitalism)?

e.g. the bicycle, on the speed vs efficiency plot

modern large-scale development [...] has given us air-conditioning, not as
an improvement, but as a necessary addition, since modern buildings have lost
the magic of pleasant temperatures that clung to the thick-walled houses of
former times.

Will the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) become an
appropriate technology? Or will it go the way of the shitstorm that is the
rest of the internet?
