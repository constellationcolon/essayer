goes on in it. [{% cite public-opinion citation-needed %}]

### On the variety of human experience in small states

> The world no longer crosses an author’s path. He must go out of his way and

> system and whose results are as much of a surprise to him as to anybody.

> A small state has the same governmental problems as the most monumental

> contact with everybody ranging from peasant wenches to rulers. As a result,
> they could write as competently on the subtleties of political doctrines as
> on the nature of the universe or the tribulations of love. And the
> characters they created in marble or in verse were not synthetic carriers of
> mass issues but human beings so full, true, and earthly that their
> unsurpassable veracity still captivates our imagination.
