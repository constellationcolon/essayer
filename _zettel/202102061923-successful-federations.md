Successful federations have "enforceable executive authority" (p. 177)

1. federal must be slightly stronger than its strongest member
1. members relatively homogeneous in size
    - else the strongest members will refuse to contribute to federal organ
      that can overshadow themselves
    - smaller member states must be able to stand together against the bigger
