One of the arguments that I think could have been made more explicit in the {%
cite breakdown-of-nations %} is that for "high entropy societies", or in the
social sciences, lower Gini coefficients.

(NB: probably not just "high efficiency", since he refers to the need for
many small states, not just equally sized big states in a federation)

One thing I find a little annoying about a minimum wage is exactly this:
inflation is a fact of our current monetary system, and having the minimum
wage be a set rate does nothing for minimum wage workers when living expenses
go up due to inflation. You can try to keep raising it, but that is a political
struggle every time you have to do it.

What we need are curbs on inequality: more laws like [Measure L in
SF][measure-l] that counter perverse concentrations of wealth.
