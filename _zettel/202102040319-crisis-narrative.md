## "Nasty, brutish, short": life of man in the perpetual state of war

> Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power
> to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and
> such a war, as is of every man, against every man.

> In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof
> is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor
> use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building;
> no instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no
> knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters;
> no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent
> death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

## No unity except in war?

> Only in a time of crisis has unity sense, when individuals and peoples are
> bound to live in a ‘military alliance’ and many of our ideals must
> temporarily be suspended.
