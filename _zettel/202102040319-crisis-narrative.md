## Nasty, brutish, short in the perpetual state of war

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war, as is of every man, against every man.

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

## No unity except in war?

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
Only in a time of crisis has unity sense, when individuals and peoples are
bound to live in a ‘military alliance’ and many of our ideals must
temporarily be suspended.

Well, conveniently for this world system, its size continually manufactures
its own crises, real (climate) and imagined (war on terror)... which also
explains its longevity.
