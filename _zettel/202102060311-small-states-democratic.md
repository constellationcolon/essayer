"[Large state =>
totalitarian]({% link _zettel/202102050003-large-states-undemocratic.md %})" 
is an intriguing possibility, and certainly jives with anthropological studies
on state formation and function. I do not believe, however, that the inverse
holds: that is to say, one cannot automatically assume "small state =>
democratic".

If anything, totalitarian control comes even more easily to hand. [Just ask
LKY.]({% link _zettel/202101280140-singapore-city-state.md %})
[{% cite breakdown-of-nations -L page -l 72 %}] talks about how

1.  Arrogance and bullying in small states by tyrants: more easily overthrown
    due to the balance of power between the state apparatus it is able to
    support and the people => Ruler more likely to appeal to popular desire
1.  Even if a tyrant arises, they can't do harm at scale since the state is so
    small. "What a blessing! Imagine, you would have to flee a distance of
    only fifteen or twenty miles to reach the safety of exile." [{% cite

but I think he may be conflating "popular desire" (a "good life" by some
majority metric, e.g. $$$) with "democracy" (rule by the people).
