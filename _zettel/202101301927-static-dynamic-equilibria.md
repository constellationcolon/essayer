- **The Stable Balance** of the dead
    - "balance of the stagnant and the huge"
    - "fixed and unchanging relationship"
    - instead of harmony, moulds diversity into unity
    - universal principle only if universe were still, non-moving, lifeless
- **The Mobile Balance** of the living
    - self-regulatory
    - coexistence of countless mobile little parts
    - moving, breathing, dynamic universe
    - ordered by harmony, not unity

  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
For what seems wrong with our political universe is, of course, not that it
is *balanced*, but that it is *badly* balanced. And it is badly balanced
because, unlike the physical universe, it is no longer composed of a great
number of small mobile units which, as we have seen, are essential to an
orderly pattern of behaviour, but of a *small* and shrinking number of
immobile, though still moving, huge unitsâ€”the great powers. With their
emergence, the mobile balance, dependent on manifold littleness, could no
longer function satisfactorily, and had to he replaced by a stable balance.
This does not mean that a stable balance is without merit. To be adequate, a
balance must furnish an automatic equilibrium which relieves its creators of
the absorbing and sterile task of keeping ii under constant supervision. It
must rest in itself. In a world of dead matter, a stable balance meets this
requirement to perfection. In fact, it is the only form of balance that
keeps inanimate things in their fixed relationships. But, while it fulfils
the requirement of adequacy in an inanimate, non-moving world, it loses its
self-regulatory character when applied to a moving and living system such as
a society of nations. Here a mobile balance is required to ensure proper
operation and the necessary correlation of perpetually occurring changes.
But a mobile balance, as we have just seen, is dependent on a multitudinous
small-cell arrangement which is disrupted when cell unifications take place
and large solidified organisms are created in the form of big powers in the
political body or of cancerous overgrowth in the human body.
