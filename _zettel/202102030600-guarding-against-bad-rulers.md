<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
There is nothing in the constitution of men or states that can prevent he
rise of dictators, fascist or otherwise. Power maniacs exist everywhere, and
every community will at some time or other pass through a phase of tyranny.
The only difference lies in the degree of tyrannical government which, in
turn, depends once more on the site and power of the countries falling victim
to it.

This sounds familiar... There was that Chinese political theorist who was
claiming that bad rulers are unavoidable, though his prescription was for
strong culture / Confucianism [{% cite citation-needed %}].
