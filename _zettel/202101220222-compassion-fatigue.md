This is also as much a function of the profit motives of the media environment

> A small-state world, by dividing our universal, permanent, impersonal
> miseries into small, discontinuous, and personal incidents, thus return us
> from the misty sombreness of an existence in which we are nothing but
> ghostly shadows; of meaningless issues, to the bliss of reality which we can
> find only in our neighbours and our neighbourhoods. There alone, love is
> love, and sex is sex, and passion is passion. If we hate a man, it is not
> because he is a communist but because he is nasty, and if we love him it is
> not because he is a patriot but because he is a gentleman. In neighbourhoods
> everything becomes part of our personal experience. Nothing remains an
> impersonal issue.
