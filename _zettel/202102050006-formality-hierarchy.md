The rulers of a small state, if they can be called that, are the citizen’s
neighbours. Since he knows them closely, they will never be able to hide
themselves in mysterious shrouds under whose cover they might take on the
dim and aloof appearance of supermen.

  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
A citizen of the Principality of Liechtenstein, whose population numbers less
than fourteen thousand, desirous to see His Serene Highness the Prince and
Sovereign, Bearer of many exalted orders and Defender of many exalted things,
can do so by ringing the bell at his castle gate. However serene His Highness
may be, he is never an inaccessible stranger. A citizen of the massive
American republic, on the other hand, encounters untold obstacles in a similar
enterprise. Trying to see his fellow citizen President, whose function is to
be his servant, not his master, he may be sent to an insane asylum for
observation or, if found sane, to a court on charges of disorderly conduct.
Both happened in 1950. In 1951, a citizen spent $1,800 in eleven months in an
effort ‘to get the President’s attention”-in vain. You will say that in a
large power such as the United States informal relationships such as exist
between government and citizen in small countries are technically unfeasible.
This is quite true. But this is exactly it. Democracy in its full meaning is
impossible in a large state which, as Aristotle already observed, is ‘almost
incapable of constitutional government.
