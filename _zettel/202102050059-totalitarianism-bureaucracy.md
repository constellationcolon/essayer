[Large societies are undemocratic]({% link _zettel/202102050003-large-states-undemocratic.md %}) & its sheer size requires constant upkeep

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">
This is quite different in the case of large powers whose enormous social
demands are such that they consume practically all the available energy not
only of their direct servants but of the citizens as well in the mere task
of keeping their immobile, clumsy societies going, and preventing their
social services from collapsing. Forever afraid of breaking underneath their
own weight, they can never release their populations from the servitude of
pressing our collective shoulders to the wheels of their stupendous
enterprise. Their purpose must by force of circumstance turn away from the
grace of individual living to the puritan virtue of co-operation which is
the law of some highly efficient animal societies but was not originally
meant to be the primary concern of human living.
