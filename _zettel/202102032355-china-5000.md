I keep coming back to that train of thought on geographical determinism that I
first encountered in (I think) {% cite guns-germs-and-steel %}, that talked
about how it was much easier to form a mega-state in the (relatively) flat,
contiguous, and irrigable valley where China is, than in, say, the territory
where Europe lies, where all would-be states and empires are broken up into
little territories by virtue of the more mountainous terrain.[^ggs] If, as
Kohr claims, collectivist attitudes are a result of social size, it'd
certainly explain some of the stereotypes of the East-West cultural divide we
hold todayâ€”as well as the ongoing collectivisation processes we see worldwide.
