title: Justifications for the difficulty of tackling the climate crisis

This is the perfect storm of mis-aligned 21st century incentives:

1.  **A planetary-scale disaster unfolding in slow motion,** with little of
    the quick or easy visual- or sound-bites so suited our attention-deficient
    consciousnesses. One can only show a hockey stick graph so many times, and
    images of polar bears seem impossibly far removed. With the Cold War, it
    was at least easy for the average person to immediately comprehend the
    consequences of a misstep: a mushroom cloud, and then—nothing. While there
    are (sadly) certainly more examples at hand today that are well suited for
    the news cycle (e.g. the orange-red skies of the Australian and
    Californian wildfires this year), how many news outlets are actually
    drawing those links between these tragedies and the consequences of our
    actions?

1.  **"Climate change is a ratings killer" — Chris Hayes** The climate crisis
    is undoubtedly a story that begins with our poor life choices, and can
    only end when we collectively acknowledge and re-evaluate them. Too often,
    this re-evaluation is cast as teeth-pulling (reducing consumption on all
    fronts, portrayed as painful despite the spiritual hollowness of modern
    consumer culture), individual consumer choice (paying more for renewable
    energy—a patent lie now that renewables are actually cheaper than fossil
    fuels) and political gridlock (COPXX; no further comment here).
    This has had the effect of turning viewers off, a no-no for any
    advertising-based business whose primary KPI is engagement. Some
    believe this is primarily because these programmes have tended to be
    [presented poorly][climate-presentation]. Others believe it to be too
    depressing—but this begs the question of how such a crisis can be more
    depressing than the endless parade of wars in the Middle East on show in
    the mass media? In the grand scheme of things, far too few outlets
    recognise this as [opportunity to rebuild][climate-rebuild] our economies
    in a way that is more just and equitable for people and living beings all
    across this Earth.

1.  **Politically sensitive implications** The climate crisis is almost
    certainly going to bring more climate refugees to the doorsteps of other
    cities, states, and nations as time goes on; the climate migrations have
    already started. 

1.  **Ideologically sensitive implications** At the heart of it, the climate
    crisis is a story about the consequences of greed, of the lie of infinite
    economic growth on a finite planet. We've lived with this story for so
    long—so many, like I, was brought up on it, spoon-fed to us as
    school-children—that we've forgotten that it was just a story of hope we
    told ourselves in an age when we were so small in number as to be
    negligible on this planet.

1.  [**Compassion fatigue**]({% link
    _zettel/202101220222-compassion-fatigue.md %}) Even for the most
    compassionate amongst us, the daily onslaught of Things Wrong With The
    World can induce a paradoxical apathy, from just having too many things to
    care about at once that we shut down as a coping mechanism.
