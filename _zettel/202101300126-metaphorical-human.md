## The Logical Human

The Most Human Human [{% cite most-human-human %}]: Our self-conception of
what makes us human has varied through time. Greeks thought it was reason and
logic that made us unique (in comparison to animals—and for those misogynists,
in comparison to women). "Calculators" used to refer to humans—savants who
could calculate things quickly in their heads. But with the proliferation of
computers (which can perform logical operations accurately and quickly—and
certainly much better by leaps and bounds than any human individual), our ego
was bruised, and we began looking for some other quality the computers didn't
have that would define us.

## The Average Human

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote" markdown="1">

The chief danger to the spirit of democracy in a large power stems from this
technical impossibility of asserting itself informally. In mass states,
personal influences can make themselves felt only if channelled through
forms, fortnulas, and organizations. [...] As a result, the individual
declines, and in his place emerges the glorified average man of whom Ortega y
Gasset writes that ‘he is to history what sea-level is to geography’.

[...]

But who is this mystical, glorified, flattered, wooed, famous, inarticulate,
faceless average man? If he is neither one individual, nor all individuals, he
is no individual at all. And if he is not an individual, he can only be one
thing, the representative or reflex of the community, of society, of the
masses. What we worship in the individualistic fiction of the average man is
nothing but the god of collectivism.
