The Most Human Human [{% cite most-human-human %}]: Our self-conception of
what makes us human has varied through time. Greeks thought it was reason and
logic that made us unique (in comparison to animals—and for those misogynists,
in comparison to women). "Calculators" used to refer to humans—savants who
could calculate things quickly in their heads. But with the proliferation of
computers (which can perform logical operations accurately and quickly—and
certainly much better by leaps and bounds than any human individual), our ego
was bruised, and we began looking for some other quality the computers didn't
have that would define us.
