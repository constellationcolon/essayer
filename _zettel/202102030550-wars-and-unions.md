One of the premises of the EU is that such a regional union fosters
cooperation and peace, truce in contrast to their bloody history. Yet there
are detractors from such oversized unions (ahem, *Brexit*)â€”of which {% cite
breakdown-of-nations %} is one, claiming that on the contrary, it is the
mega-unions waging wars eternal. Is it possible to keep the peace without
having to resort to hegemony?

The Kohr argument: there are going to be wars anyway. Let them get it
out, don't stand in their way, but keep them as skirmishes between piddly
parties rather than gargantuan wars between superpowers that suck in the
entirety of humankind.

~ forest management & fire suppression practices. Small, controlled burns can
be beneficial in clearing out dead wood while doing little harm to living
tress, and allowing for forests to regenerate. Suppressing fires absolutely
(e.g. to protect property at all costs) has the potential of letting fuel
build up over time, increasing the risks of megafires that kill even the living
trees and lay waste to the entire forest in the end.
