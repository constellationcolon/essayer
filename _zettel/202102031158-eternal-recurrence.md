I feel it deeper than my bones. I feel it murmuring in the atoms and the
molecules currently trapped in this ephemeral body, these atoms forged in the
depths of the stars and the explosions of the supernovae, these atoms that have
orbited this same small, yellow star for billions of years, these atoms that
have been cyanobacteria and dinosaurs and Murasaki and every body in between.
Atoms that have seen empires rise and fall, and watched the ever-encroaching
enclosure of this planet as we crowd ourselves to our final asphyxiation.
