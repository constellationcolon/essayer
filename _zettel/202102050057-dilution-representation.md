Thus, the greater the aggregation, the more dwarfish becomes man. But this
is not all, for along with the decline of a personâ€™s share in sovereignty
goes a decline in his share in government. Since effective legislatures
cannot expand their membership in proportion to the growth of their
countries, increasing population must ultimately lessen democratic
representation. In 1790, the average constituency of a member of the House
of Representatives in the United States comprised 33,000 citizens. If this
ratio were still to prevail, the membership of the House would today be in
the neighbourhood of 4,760, a figure that would make any sensible
legislative action all but impossible.

(Q: connection to logic of collective choice? Fairer outcome => more
concentration of power?)
