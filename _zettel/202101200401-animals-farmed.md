*The Guardian* has a series called "[Animals Farmed]" that talks about the
fallout from our insatiable appetite for cheap meat, from the intensive farming
industry that feeds it.

A nod to *Animal Farm* [{% cite animal-farm %}], in which the pigs, leaders of
the communist animals, are finally revealed to be no different than the
capitalist humans they had rebelled against in the first place.

The metaphor cuts deep. Possibly deeper than Orwell himself first intended.
For to look directly at the graphic inhumanity of modern farming [{% cite
modern-farming-dont %}] is, disconcertingly, but to look into a mirror of our
own lives.

From the inimitable Radiohead: [{% cite fitter-happier %}]
<verse>
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
...
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics
</verse>

And the slightly more prosaic: [{% cite

[AI hog-farming in China][ai-pig-china], where apparently crowded conditions
during animal transport has caused such stress to piglets they start biting
each other's tails off, and some pigs have evolved to have shorter / no tail.
