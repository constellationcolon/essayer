title: Animals Farmed
---

*The Guardian* has a series called "[Animals Farmed]" that talks about the
fallout from our insatiable appetite for cheap meat, from the intensive farming
industry that feeds it.

A nod to George Orwell's *Animal Farm* [{% cite animal-farm %}], in which the
pigs, leaders of the communist animals, are finally revealed to be no different
than the capitalist humans they had rebelled against in the first place.

The metaphor cuts deep. Possibly deeper than Orwell himself first intended.
For to look directly at the graphic inhumanity of modern farming [{% cite
modern-farming-dont %}] is, disconcertingly, but to look into a mirror of our
own lives.

From the inimitable Radiohead: [{% cite fitter-happier %}]
<verse>
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
...
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics
</verse>

And the slightly more prosaic: [{% cite
animals-territory-metamorphoses %}]

> Animals have thus preceded us on the path of liberal extermination. All the
> aspects of the modern treatment of animals retrace the vicissitudes of the
> manipulation of humans, from experimentation to industrial pressure in

> One has never said better how much "humanism," "normality," "quality of
> life" were nothing but the vicissitudes of profitability. The parallel
> between these animals sick from surplus value and humans sick from
> industrial concentration, from the scientific organization of work and
> assembly-line factories is illuminating. In the latter case as well, the
> capitalist "breeders" were led to a revision that was destructive of the
> mode of exploitation, innovating and reinventing the "quality of work," the
> "enrichment of tasks," discovering the "human" sciences and the
> "psychosociological" dimension of the factory. Only the inevitability of
> death renders the example of the animals more shocking still than that of
> men on an assembly line.
