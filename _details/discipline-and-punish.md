## Four general rules
{% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter-l 1.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
1. "Regard punishment as a complex social function."
1. "Regard punishment as a political tactic."
1. "[I]n short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the
humanization of the penal system and of the knowledge of man."
1. "[W]hether this entry of the soul [...] and with it the insertion in legal
practice of a whole corpus of 'scientific' knowledge, is not the effect of
a transformation of the way in which the body itself is invested by power
relations."

## Political economy of the body

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> We must first rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all (if
> not exclusively) a means of reducing crime and [...] tend towards expiation
> of obtaining redress, towards the pursuit of individuals or the attribution
> of collective responsibility. [...] we must show that punitive measures are
> not simply 'negative' mechanisms that make it possible to repress, to
> prevent, to exclude, to eliminate; but that they are linked to a whole
> series of positive and useful effects which it is their task to support.
> [...] From this point of view, Rusche and Kirchheimer relate the different
> *systems of punishment* with the *systems of production* within which they
> operate: thus, in a slave economy, punitive mechanisms serve to provide an
> additional labour force – and to constitute a body of 'civil' slaves in
> addition to those provided by war or trading; with feudalism, at a time when
> money and production were still at an early stage of development, we find a
> sudden increase in corporal punishments – the body being in most cases the
> only property accessible; the penitentiary (the Hôpital Général, the
> Spinhuis or the Rasphuis), forced labour and the prison factory appear with
> the development of the mercantile economy. But the industrial system
> requires a free market in labour and, in the nineteenth century, the role of
> forced labour in the mechanisms of punishment diminishes accordingly and
> 'corrective' detention takes its place.

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> Historians long ago began to write the history of the body. [...] they have

> power is possible only if it is caught up in a system of subjection (in
> which need is also a political instrument meticulously prepared, calculated

## Micro-physics of power

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> one should decipher in it a network of relations, constantly in tension, in

> rather than possessed; it is not the 'privilege', acquired or preserved, of
> the dominant class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions – an
> effect that is manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those
> who are dominated. Furthermore, this power is not exercised simply as an
> obligation or a prohibition on those who 'do not have it'; it invests them,
> is transmitted by them and through them; it exerts pressure upon them, just
> as they themselves, in their struggle against it, resist the grip it has on
> them. [...] The overthrow of these 'micro-powers' does not, then, obey the
> law of all or nothing; it is not acquired once and for all by a new control
> of the apparatuses nor by a new functioning or a destruction of the
> institutions; on the other hand, none of its localized episodes may be
> inscribed in history except by the effects that it induces on the entire
> network in which it is caught up.

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> The history of this 'micro-physics' of the punitive power would then be a
> genealogy or an element in a genealogy of the modern 'soul'. Rather than
> seeing this soul as the reactivated remnants of an ideology, one would see
> it as the present correlative of a certain technology of power over the
> body. It would be wrong to say that the soul is an illusion, or an

## Power and Knowedge

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}

> same token, the renunciation of power is one of the conditions of knowledge.

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l I.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> To analyse the political investment of the body and the micro-physics of

## Semio-technique for the power to punish

1. *The rule of minimum quantity*{% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish
   -L chapter -l II.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}

1. *The rule of sufficient ideality*

    > This means that the 'pain' at the heart of punishment is not the actual
    > sensation of pain, but the idea of pain, displeasure, inconvenience –
    > the 'pain' of the idea of 'pain'. Punishment has to make use not of the
    > body, but of representation.

1. *The rule of lateral effects*

    > The penalty must have its most intense effects on those who have not
    > committed the crime; to carry the argument to its limit, if one could be
    > sure that the criminal could not repeat the crime, it would be enough to
    > make others believe that he had been punished.

1. *The rule of perfect certainty*

    > With the idea of each crime and the advantages to be expected of it must
    > be associated the idea of a particular punishment with the precise
    > inconveniences that result from it; the link from one to the other must
    > be regarded as necessary and unbreakable.
    >
    > These laws must be published, so that everyone has access to them; what
    > is needed is not oral traditions and customs, but a written legislation
    > which can be 'the stable monument of the social pact', printed texts
    > available to all: 'Only printing can make the public as a whole and not
    > just a few persons depositories of the sacred code of the laws'
    > (Beccaria, 26).

## Man-the-machine

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l III.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> The classical age discovered the body as object and target of power. [...]
> The great book of Man-the-Machine was written simultaneously on two
> registers: the anatomico-metaphysical register, of which Descartes wrote the
> first pages and which the physicians and philosophers continued, and the
> technico-political register, which was constituted by a whole set of
> regulations and by empirical and calculated methods relating to the army,
> the school and the hospital, for controlling or correcting the operations of
> the body. These two registers are quite distinct, since it was a question,
> on the one hand, of submission and use and, on the other, of functioning and
> explanation: there was a useful body and an intelligible body. And yet there
> are points of overlap from one to the other. La Mettrie's L'Homme-machine is
> both a materialist reduction of the soul and a general theory of dressage,
> at the centre of which reigns the notion of 'docility', which joins the
> analysable body to the manipulable body. A body is docile that may be
> subjected, used, transformed and improved. The celebrated automata, on the
> other hand, were not only a way of illustrating an organism, they were also
> political puppets, small-scale models of power: Frederick II, the meticulous
> king of small machines, well-trained regiments and long exercises, was
> obsessed with them.

## Docile bodies

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l III.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> What was so new in these projects of docility that interested the eighteenth
> century so much? It was certainly not the first time that the body had
> become the object of such imperious and pressing investments; in every
> society, the body was in the grip of very strict powers, which imposed on it
> constraints, prohibitions or obligations. However, there were several new
> things in these techniques. To begin with, there was the scale of the
> control: it was a question not of treating the body, en masse, 'wholesale',
> as if it were an indissociable unity, but of working it 'retail',
> individually; of exercising upon it a subtle coercion, of obtaining holds
> upon it at the level of the mechanism itself – movements, gestures,
> attitudes, rapidity: an infinitesimal power over the active body. Then there
> was the object of the control: it was not or was no longer the signifying
> elements of behaviour or the language of the body, but the economy, the
> efficiency of movements, their internal organization; constraint bears upon
> the forces rather than upon the signs; the only truly important ceremony is
> that of exercise. Lastly, there is the modality: it implies an
> uninterrupted, constant coercion, supervising the processes of the activity
> rather than its result and it is exercised according to a codification that
> partitions as closely as possible time, space, movement.

New in the eighteenth century projects of docility:

1.  *Scale* not en masse, but infinitesimal; "micro-managing"

1.  *Object of control* not the signs of the body, but the forces

1.  *Modality* incessant control over partitioned space-time

## Disciplines

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish  -L chapter -l III.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> These methods, which made possible the meticulous control of the operations
> of the body, which assured the constant subjection of its forces and imposed
> upon them a relation of docility-utility, might be called 'disciplines'.
> Many disciplinary methods had long been in existence – in monasteries,
> armies, workshops. But in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth
> centuries the disciplines became general formulas of domination.

Different from slavery, from service, from vassalage, from asceticism and from 'disciplines' of a monastic type.

> The historical moment of the disciplines was the moment when an art of the
> human body was born, which was directed not only at the growth of its

> of a relation that in the mechanism itself makes it more obedient as it
> becomes more useful, and conversely. [...] A 'political anatomy', which was
> also a 'mechanics of power', was being born; it defined how one may have a
> hold over others' bodies, not only so that they may do what one wishes, but
> so that they may operate as one wishes, with the techniques, the speed and

> practised bodies, 'docile' bodies.

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l III.1 %}{% endmarginnote %} 
> Discipline increases the forces of the body (in economic terms of utility)
> and diminishes these same forces (in political terms of obedience). In

> it reverses the course of the energy, the power that might result from it,
> and turns it into a relation of strict subjection. If economic exploitation

## Disciplinary institutions

> {% marginnote %}{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l III.1 %}{% endmarginnote %}
> The 'invention' of this new political anatomy must not be seen as a sudden

> organization. They sometimes circulated very rapidly from one point to
> another (between the army and the technical schools or secondary schools),
> sometimes slowly and discreetly (the insidious militarization of the large
> workshops). On almost every occasion, they were adopted in response to
> particular needs: an industrial innovation, a renewed outbreak of certain

> This did not prevent them being totally inscribed in general and essential
> transformations, which we must now try to delineate.

## The art of distributions

{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l III.1 %}

1.  *Enclosure* monasteries, homeless shelters, colleges, boarding schools,
    military barracks, factories and workers dormitories

1.  *Partitioning* e.g. the monastic cell

    > Avoid distributions in groups; break up collective dispositions; analyse
    > confused, massive or transient pluralities. Disciplinary space tends to
    > be divided into as many sections as there are bodies or elements to be
    > distributed. One must eliminate the effects of imprecise distributions,
    > the uncontrolled disappearance of individuals, their diffuse
    > circulation, their unusable and dangerous coagulation; it was a tactic
    > of anti-desertion, anti-vagabondage, anti-concentration.

1.  *Functional sites* specialisation à la Economics' pin-factory
    
    > By walking up and down the central aisle of the workshop, it was
    > possible to carry out a supervision that was both general and
    > individual: to observe the worker’s presence and application, and the
    > quality of his work; to compare workers with one another, to classify
    > them according to skill and speed; to follow the successive stages of
    > the production process. All these serializations formed a permanent
    > grid: confusion was eliminated: that is to say, production was divided
    > up and the labour process was articulated, on the one hand, according to
    > its stages or elementary operations, and, on the other hand, according
    > to the individuals, the particular bodies, that carried it out: each
    > variable of this force – strength, promptness, skill, constancy – would
    > be observed, and therefore characterized, assessed, computed and related
    > to the individual who was its particular agent. Thus, spread out in a
    > perfectly legible way over the whole series of individual bodies, the
    > work force may be analysed in individual units. At the emergence of
    > large-scale industry, one finds, beneath the division of the production
    > process, the individualizing fragmentation of labour power; the
    > distributions of the disciplinary space often assured both.

1.  *Interchangeability*
    
    > Discipline is an art of rank, a technique for the transformation of
    > arrangements. It individualizes bodies by a location that does not give
    > them a fixed position, but distributes them and circulates them in a
    > network of relations.

## The control of activity

{% cite discipline-and-punish -L chapter -l III.1 %}

1. *Time-table* monastaries -> schools, workshops and hospitals

1. *The temporal elaboration of the act* e.g. marching

    > What the ordinance of 1766 defines is not a time-table – the general
    > framework for an activity; it is rather a collective and obligatory
    > rhythm, imposed from the outside; it is a ‘programme’; it assures the
    > elaboration of the act itself; it controls its development and its
    > stages from the inside. [...] A sort of anatomo-chronological schema of
    > behaviour is defined. The act is broken down into its elements; the
    > position of the body, limbs, articulations is defined; to each movement
    > are assigned a direction, an aptitude, a duration; their order of
    > succession is prescribed. Time penetrates the body and with it all the
    > meticulous controls of power.

1.  *The correlation of the body and the gesture* e.g. proper handwriting,
    posture

1.  *The body–object articulation*

    > This obligatory syntax is what the military theoreticians of the eighteenth century called ‘manoeuvre’. The traditional recipe gives place to explicit and obligatory prescriptions. Over the whole surface of contact between the body and the object it handles, power is introduced, fastening them to one another. It constitutes a body-weapon, body-tool, body-machine complex. One is as far as possible from those forms of subjection that demanded of the body only signs or products, forms of expression or the result of labour. The regulation imposed by power is at the same time the law of construction of the operation. Thus disciplinary power appears to have the function not so much of deduction as of synthesis, not so much of exploitation of the product as of coercive link with the apparatus of production.

1.  *Exhaustive use*

    > The principle that underlay the time-table in its traditional form was
    > essentially negative; it was the principle of non-idleness: it was
    > forbidden to waste time, which was counted by God and paid for by men;
    > the time-table was to eliminate the danger of wasting it – a moral
    > offence and economic dishonesty. Discipline, on the other hand, arranges
    > a positive economy; it poses the principle of a theoretically
    > ever-growing use of time: exhaustion rather than use; it is a question
    > of extracting, from time, ever more available moments and, from each
    > moment, ever more useful forces.

> All these serializations formed a permanent grid: confusion was eliminated2: that is to say, production was divided up and the labour process was articulated, on the one hand, according to its stages or elementary operations, and, on the other hand, according to the individuals, the particular bodies, that carried it out: each variable of this force – strength, promptness, skill, constancy – would be observed, and therefore characterized, assessed, computed and related to the individual who was its particular agent. Thus, spread out in a perfectly legible way over the whole series of individual bodies, the work force may be analysed in individual units. At the emergence of large-scale industry, one finds, beneath the division of the production process, the individualizing fragmentation of labour power; the distributions of the disciplinary space often assured both.

Emphasis on deviation (deviance) rather than on the mean + the systematised
population.
