So much tea packed into one book:

1.  The {% sc TL;DR %} on the "third-world debt crisis" you hear from time to
    time (but whose origins never get explained): the {% sc OPEC %} had a glut
    of money lying around from the oil crisis in the 70's, and deposited it in
    Western banks. Western banks now had a glut of money they wanted to get
    interest on, so they teamed up with the {% sc IMF %} / World Bank and
    started offering "development loans" to "developing" countries, agreed
    upon by the ruling elites of those countries. That borrowed money didn't
    exactly trickle down to the ordinary people in those countries, but it was
    still ultimately the ordinary people who had to repay the principal +
    interest on those loans via taxes (surprise, surprise). The net effect
    being that the outflow of money from the poorer countries to the rich was
    actually larger than the inflow, i.e. the poorer countries of the world
    were technically, all told, sending financial aid to the richer
    countries(’ financial elites).

1.  The origin myth of money (i.e. that tale they told you about primitives
    wanting to barter but not having things of equal value to exchange on
    hand) was pretty much a fabrication by Adam Smith et al. They were trying
    to justify instituting economics as its own field of study, supposedly
    prior to and hence independent from politics or ethics.

1.  In fact, Smith's famous "invisible hand", as well as the anecdote about
    the pin factory, both appear to have been ~~lifted~~ uh, _inspired_ by
    earlier sources in Islamic philosophy that reached European audiences
    during the Enlightenment. (In addition to other such derivative works by
    Descartes, Hume, and Kant.)

1.  Credit as a concept existed before money ever did, often as a way of
    arranging social relations within a community.

1.  There used to be regular "debt-forgiveness decrees" e.g. in Egypt, where
    during a debt crisis, everyone's debts, then recorded on tablets, would
    get erased, and the tablets broken. Everyone would get to start over,
    literally on a clean slate. The Rosetta Stone—so famous for its key role
    in the translation of texts—is actually a record of such a decree by
    Ptolemy V.

1.  Money (specifically, coinage) only became important in conjunction with
    warfare, whereas credit was more widely used amongst civilians in
    peacetime. Which makes sense—if I know where you live, you know where I
    live, neither of us is going anywhere any time soon, and we're not at war
    with each other, why bother being so pedantic (not to mention
    un-neighbourly) about up-front payments? Coinage, on the other hand, is
    important if there's some marauding army passing through, you don't trust
    the other party one bit, and would rather sooner have nothing more to do
    with the other. Graeber dubs this the _military-slavery-coinage complex_.

1.  This complex started in what he dubs the Axial Age—the same age in which
    Pythagoras, the Buddha, and Confucius were contemporaries (circa 500    
    {% sc BC %}), and the major world philosophies/religions arose, in
    response to this great rending of social relations due to incessant
    warfare.

1.  Interest—usury—was banned / considered immoral under most / all of these
    philosophies.

1.  The Muslim traders were actually the first ones famous for setting up
    trading outposts all out across the Indian Ocean, and had somehow all
    managed to agree to keep their wars to dry land, reserving the seas for
    peaceful commerce.{% sidenote %}Which explains my own long-standing
    question about the origins of Islamic cultures in South-east Asian
    communities. They don't teach you much about this in Singapore, despite
    having what they like to call a "world-class education system".{%
    endsidenote %}

1.  The colonization of the Americas, specifically the enslavement of Native
    Americans in the American gold and silver mines, wouldn't have been so
    profitable were it not for the then insatiable appetite of the dynamic
    Chinese market for bullion, and the demand for "eastern luxuries" in (the
    rich parts of) Europe. (In fact, prices for silver collapsed in Europe
    around that time from over-supply.) Eventually, though, they got tired of
    having to export so much bullion that they started the Opium War to try
    and settle that balance of payments.

1.  Your 401K (or equivalent retirement account invested in {% sc US %}
    government bonds)? That's basically you financing {% sc US %} government
    debt, above and on top of what you already pay in taxes. And so where does
    the money come from to finance the interest on those government loans? ;)
