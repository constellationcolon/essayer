Of course, that still hasn't stopped the physicists, thinking they've solved
the secrets of universe, from [flouncing into other fields][trivial],
[pronouncing those fields 'trivial'][witten], and [imposing their 'expert'
opinion on them][covid-19-physicist] by [slapping an Ising model on the whole
shebang][covid-19-ising].
