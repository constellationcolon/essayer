I find it a little ironic that a book about how "smaller nations are better"
opens with this grand claim that he's going to propose herein one single
social model to rule them all. I suppose even he couldn't help but get caught
up in the hard-science envy of the day.

Ok but NYC is remarkably safe despite its size and density?? But I may be

This is an interesting point, given [other discussions][just-mercy] on justice

"United States": small states only in government, not in enterprise

Only president has term limits, corporations face litte/no effective limits on
size or power.

## Questions

1.  Assuming small is indeed beautiful, how are we to effectively work against
    the expansionary tendencies of our contemporary ideology? How does one
    stand against monopolistic practices, against consolidation, against
    over-size in corporations, organisations, nations?

1.  One of the premises of the EU is that such a regional union fosters
    cooperation and peace, truce in contrast to their bloody history. Yet
    there are detractors from such oversized unions (ahem, *Brexit*)—of which
    this book is possibly one, who claim that on the contrary, it is the
    mega-unions waging wars eternal. Is it possible to keep the peace without
    having to resort to hegemony?

    (The Kohr argument: there are going to be wars anyway. Let them get it
    out, don't stand in their way, but keep them as skirmishes between piddly
    parties rather than gargantuan wars between superpowers that suck in the
    entirety of humankind.)
