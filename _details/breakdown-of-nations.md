I find it a little ironic that a book about how "smaller nations are better"
opens with this grand claim that he's going to propose herein one single
social model to rule them all. I suppose even he couldn't help but get caught
up in the hard-science envy of the day.

So much Orientalism on page 9:

## Power (size) theory of social misery

## Questions

1.  Assuming small is indeed beautiful, how are we to effectively work against
    the expansionary tendencies of our contemporary ideology? How does one
    stand against monopolistic practices, against consolidation, against
    over-size in corporations, organisations, nations?

1.  One of the premises of the EU is that such a regional union fosters
    cooperation and peace, truce in contrast to their bloody history. Yet there
    are detractors from such oversized unions—of which this book is possibly
    one, who claim that on the contrary, it is the mega-unions waging wars
    eternal. Is it possible to keep the peace without having to resort to
    hegemony?
