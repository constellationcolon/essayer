## On Surnames & the State

> The invention of permanent, inherited patronyms was, after the
> administrative simplification of nature (for example, the forest) and space
> (for example, land tenure), the last step in establishing the necessary
> preconditions of modern statecraft. In almost every case it was a state
> project, designed to allow officials to identify, unambiguously, the
> majority of its citizens. When successful, it went far to create a legible
> people.38 Tax and tithe rolls, property rolls, conscription lists, censuses,
> and property deeds recognized in law were inconceivable without some means
> of fixing an individual's identity and linking him or her to a kin group.
> Campaigns to assign permanent patronyms have typically taken place, as one
> might expect, in the context of a state's exertions to put its fiscal system
> on a sounder and more lucrative footing. Fearing, with good reason, that an
> effort to enumerate and register them could be a prelude to some new tax
> burden or conscription, local officials and the population at large often
> resisted such campaigns.

An interesting account of the origins of the term 老百姓—usually denoting "the
common people", but literally means the Classic Hundred Surnames.

> If permanent surnames were largely a project of official legibility, then
> they should have appeared earliest in those societies with precocious
> states. China provides a striking example.39 By roughly the fourth century
> B.C. (although the exact timing and comprehensiveness are in dispute), the
> Qin dynasty had apparently begun imposing surnames on much of its population
> and enumerating them for the purposes of taxes, forced labor, and
> conscription.40 This initiative may well have been the origin of the term
> "laobaixing," meaning, literally, "the old one hundred surnames," which in
> modern China has come to mean "the common people." Before this, the fabled
> Chinese patrilineage, while established among ruling houses and related
> lines, was absent among commoners. They did not have surnames, nor did they
> even imitate elite practices in this respect. The assigning of patronyms by
> family was integral to state policy promoting the status of (male) family
> heads, giving them legal jurisdiction over their wives, children, and
> juniors and, not incidentally, holding them accountable for the fiscal
> obligations of the entire family.41 This (Qin) policy required registering
> the entire population, after which the "hodgepodge of terms by which people
> were called were all classified as hsing [surname], to be passed down to
> their patrilineal descendants indefinitely."42 On this account, both the
> establishment of permanent patronyms and the creation of the patrilineal
> family itself can be attributed to early state simplification.
