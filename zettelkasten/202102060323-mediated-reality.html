  <p id="paragraph-0">Lippmann re: society being too large for anyone to know everything that
goes on in it. [<a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">Lippmann, 1922; <i>Citation Needed</i>, n.d.</a>]</p>

<h2 id="on-the-variety-of-human-experience-in-small-states">On the variety of human experience in small states</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-1">The world no longer crosses an author’s path. He must go out of his way and
discover it indirectly and laboriously from encyclopaedias and monographs, or
from the writings of other hard-working students. If he can afford it, he
keeps a staff of researchers who do the learning and experiencing for him
without knowing what all their work is for, while he himself does nothing
but act as the mechanical computer of the figures which are fed into his
system and whose results are as much of a surprise to him as to anybody.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-3">Philosophers in small states—ancient Greeks, ancient Chinese—had so much
wisdom to dispense because they interacted directly and regularly with all
aspects of lived reality in their societies.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-4">A small state has the same governmental problems as the most monumental
power on earth, ever, as a small circle has the same number of degrees as a
large one. But what in the latter cannot be discerned by an army of
statisticians and specialized interpreters, could be perceived by every
leisurely stroller in ancient Athens. As a result, if we really want to go
to the bottom of things, we have even today no other recourse after having
tried Harvard and Oxford than to take down from their dusty shelves Plato or
Aristotle. Indeed, the worth of Harvard and Oxford lies largely in the fact
that they keep on their shelves the great men of little states.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-5">Yet these were no supermen. The secret of their wisdom was that they lived
in a small society that displayed all the secrets of life before everybody’s
eyes. They saw each problem not as a giant part of an unsurveyable tableau,
but as a fraction of the composite picture to which it belonged.
Philosophers, as also poets and artists, were by nature universal geniuses
because they always saw the totality of life in its full richness, variety,
and harmony without having to rely on secondhand information or to resort to
superhuman efforts. Without going out of their way or making a special job
of it, they could witness in a day’s passing jealousy, murder, rape,
magnanimity, and bliss. Their life was a constant participation in human and
political passions. It was not spent in modern one-dimensional incestuous
intercourse with individuals sharing one’s own interests, but in daily
contact with everybody ranging from peasant wenches to rulers. As a result,
they could write as competently on the subtleties of political doctrines as
on the nature of the universe or the tribulations of love. And the
characters they created in marble or in verse were not synthetic carriers of
mass issues but human beings so full, true, and earthly that their
unsurpassable veracity still captivates our imagination.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-8">[The Romans] had administrators, strategists, road builders, and
amassers of stones in giant structures whose forms could be designed by
every two-year-old playing in the sand. They had great law-givers and
masters of government, but so had the Huns.</p>

Greeks, Jews, or other members of small, disunited, and quarrelsome tribes
whom they bought on the slave markets like chattels and who lectured and
mastered them like the barbarians they were.</p>
