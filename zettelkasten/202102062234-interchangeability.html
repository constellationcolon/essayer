  <div class="main-text">
  <p id="paragraph-0">Foucault on “the art of distributions”: interchangeability of individualised
bodies, discipline as “an art of rank”, of arranging hierarchical relations
between said bodies.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">Interchangeability—disposability—of humans in transnational capitalism.
Sweatshop workers &amp; the “precession of simulacra” (marketing) in manufacturing
[<a class="citation" href="#no-logo">Klein, 1999</a>]. Gig economy &amp; “microwork”. “Personal branding”,
“thinkfluencers”, and the corporatisation of the self.</p>

<p id="paragraph-2">Interchangeability—indistinguishability—of regions and states in transnational
capitalism. Export processing zones and the global race to the bottom.
National identity as external differentiator (tourism + foreign direct
investment) rather than internal assimilator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-3">But since the 1990s, and through the years of Peak Davos, the high sermons
of globalisation have worn away this idea – insisting that countries were
just shop stalls in a planetwide marketplace, not romantic distillations of
some irreducible national spirit. They could be treated, and so ought to
behave, like corporations. In an era when money, influence and people could
flow anywhere, countries that aspired to be a destination for these energies
had to sell themselves hard. <strong>A nation’s identity, for perhaps the first
time, had to pull the rest of the world in, rather than bind the nation
against the rest of the world.</strong></p>
