weak. Their leaders could not get away with stupidity, not even in the short
run. It is not by accident that the politically and socially most advanced
countries of the world today are states such as Switzerland (4 million
inhabitants), Denmark (4 million), Sweden (7 million), Norway (3 million),
Iceland (less than 160 thousand). Large powers, on the other hand, can get
away with stupidity for prolonged periods. But who amongst us, if he feels
that he can get away with stupidity, which can be had so effortlessly, will
ever take the trouble and pains of being wise?

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The first and most important benefit derived from a small-state
arrangement is thus the shortening of a dictator’s life span or, at least,
of his term of office-unless he decides to be wise rather than to engage
in self-destructive assertions of his power. And this is the second
benefit. Since arrogance and bullying are dangerous in a small state, a
dictator cherishing his life is practically driven into a rule beneficial
to the public. Deprived of the opportunity of glorying in the pleasures of
vice, he will do the next best thing and glory in the more subtle
satisfactions of virtue. He will employ architects and painters rather
than generals and hangmen, and improve the lot of the workers rather than
the glamour of his soldiers’ uniforms.

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-1">Yet by 1999, Lee had failed in Suzhou. Five years into the project’s 20-year
development plan, Suzhou Industrial Park had only attracted $754 million
dollars of investment out of target of $20 billion, 5,000 residents out of
target of 600,000 and 14,000 employees out of a target of 360,000. The Far
East Economic Review reported that development costs had climbed to nearly
$400 million but “profitability remain[ed] a distant hope.” Singapore
subsequently disengaged from the project in 2001, reducing its stake to 35%.
Lee had meticulously transplanted Singapore’s methods to Suzhou. Even the
‘ready-built factories’ constructed in Suzhou Industrial Park were made by
the same government-linked organization that oversaw much of Singapore’s
earlier industrial development. Yet competition for foreign direct
investment from nearby Suzhou New District—a smaller, older, and
less-supported development that Singapore previously dismissed—proved too
fierce. <em>Singapore’s elite group of civil servants simply could not navigate
China’s multi-level government and apply the Singapore model at scale.</em></p>
