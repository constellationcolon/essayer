  <blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-0">The great number of proud, democratic, and almost sovereign cantons, and the
small number of the individual cantonal populations, eliminate all possible
imperialist ambitions on the @art of any one canton, because it would always
be outnumbered by even a very small combination of others which at all times
would be at the disposal of the federal government.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-2">Thus, if our present unifiers really want union, they must have disunion
first. If Europe is to be united under the auspices of the European Council,
its participating great powers must first be dissolved to a degree that, as
in Switzerland or the United States, none of its component units is left
with a significant superiority in size and strength over the others. In
their present shape, Germany, France, and Italy can never be successfully
joined together. Nor could France and Great Britain, as was demonstrated in
the case of the Western Union. But Alsace, Burgundy, Navarre, Bavaria,
Saxony, Wales, Cornwall, Scotland, Lombardy, and Parma can.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-4">They do not seem to want life in vast meaningless realms. They want to live
in their provinces, in their mountains, in their valleys. They want to live
at home. This is why they have clung so tenaciously to their local colour
and provincialism even when they were submerged in great empires. In the
end, however, it was always the small state, not the empire, that survived.
That is why small states do not have to be created artificially. They need
only be freed.</p>
