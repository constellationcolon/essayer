  <div class="quote">
    <p id="paragraph-0">As long as the victims of persecution are few, the method of execution or,
to use a Marxian term, the <em>mode of production</em>, will consist in ceremonial
knifings, hangings, or shootings, preceded by a semblance of legal process
and followed by a semblance of civilized burial. The executioners, moreover,
still not quite sure as to the sufficiency of their power and still feeling
their wrong because of the singularity of their acts, will have an urge to
apologize. But as the number of their victims increases, the time for
apologies and even for indulging in guilt feelings begins to dwindle, and
individual executions or burials not only become cumbersome but technically
unfeasible. So new practices have to be initiated. Now the victims are led
to wells, trenches, or rivers, executed, on the spot, and then simply thrown
in. This represents less an increase in viciousness than an adjustment to
the requirements of new situations which could not be handled with previous
means.</p>

<p id="paragraph-4">Illich used to wave off people fundraising for some distant cause or another,
saying “I don’t care”. This is despite—or perhaps because of—all the work he’d
done as a priest with South American communities. He insists he doesn’t care,
because he recognises his limits as a human being, and that to really <em>care</em>
about someone hurting far off requires him to drop all he’s doing, and rush
immediately to their side to care for those people. To pay undue attention to
far-off suffering is to blind ourselves to the people right in front of us, in
our immediate vicinity, who may be suffering just the same (he had a much
better way of putting this) [<a class="citation" href="#illich-in-conversation">Cayley, 1992</a>]</p>
