  <h2 id="votation--representation">Votation != Representation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-0">“The people” consists of not just voters. Who gets to vote? Biased via
non-universal suffrage—age, ethnicity, gender, etc., voter suppression,
gerrymandering. <em>The People</em> is the entire living population, their
ancestors, and their descendants.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-1">In order to do so it is necessary at the outset to reduce the ambiguity of
the term “the people.” For it has two different meanings, which it may be
convenient to distinguish typographically. When we speak of popular
sovereignty, we must know whether we are talking about The People, as
voters, or about <em>The People</em>, as a community of the entire living
population, with their predecessors and successors.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-2">It is often assumed, but without warrant, that the opinions of The People
as voters can be treated as the expression of the interests of <em>The
People</em> as an historic community. The crucial problem of modern democracy
arises from the fact that this assumption is false. The voters cannot be
relied upon to represent <em>The People</em>. The opinions of voters in elections
are not to be accepted unquestioningly as true judgments of the vital
interests of the community.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-3">[…]</p>

  <p id="paragraph-4">The inhabitants of the United States who were qualified to vote for these
delegates were not a large number. They included no slaves, no women and,
except in New York, only such adult males as could pass property and other
highly restrictive tests. […]</p>

  <p id="paragraph-5">Because of the discrepancy between The People as voters and <em>The People</em>
as the corporate nation, the voters have no title to consider themselves
the proprietors of the commonwealth and to claim that their interests are
identical with the public interest. A prevailing plurality of the voters
are not <em>The People</em>. The claim that they are is a bogus title invoked to
justify the usurpation of the executive power by representative assemblies
and the intimidation of public men by demagogic politicians. In fact
demagoguery can be described as the sleight of hand by which a faction of
The People as voters are invested with the authority of <em>The People</em>. That
is why so many crimes are committed in the people’s name.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-6">[…]</p>

  <p id="paragraph-7">The people, then, is not only, as Bentham assumed, the aggregate of living
persons. The people is also the stream of individuals, the connected
generations of changing persons, that Burke was talking about when he
invoked the partnership “not only between those who are living” but also
with “those who are dead, and those who are to be born.” <em>The People</em> are a
corporation, an entity, that is to say, which lives on while individuals
come into it and go out of it.</p>

children still get bundled off to school with other children—so that they
don’t get in the way of the adults being productive. What a way to show young
people how much society values their health or well-being as compared to GDP!</p>
