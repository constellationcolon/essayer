  <p id="paragraph-0">One of the premises of the EU is that such a regional union fosters
cooperation and peace, truce in contrast to their bloody history. Yet there
are detractors from such oversized unions (ahem, <em>Brexit</em>)—of which <a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978</a> is one, claiming that on the contrary, it is the
mega-unions waging wars eternal. Is it possible to keep the peace without
having to resort to hegemony?</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">The Kohr argument: there are going to be wars anyway. Let them get it
out, don’t stand in their way, but keep them as skirmishes between piddly
parties rather than gargantuan wars between superpowers that suck in the
entirety of humankind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-2">Small tribes agglomerated after warfare, reducing internal warfare but
continuing external warfare, with the result of having fewer, but larger,
more devastating wars over the millennia</p>

  <p id="paragraph-3">Now let us turn our back on the Middle Ages, and see what happened when the
small-state world with its ever-feuding parts and operetta wars gave way to
our modern large-power system. The reason and apology with which it
introduced itself to historians was the pacification of large regions
previously torn by tribal warfare. In this it unquestionably succeeded and,
because most of us grunt with delight whenever we hear the word peace, it is
applauded on this account to this very day. But was the result of this
regional pacification peace? Hardly. For as soon as the new nation states
had established themselves on firm ground and pacified their new dominions
into reliable and well co-ordinated units, their natural aggressiveness began
to assert itself in exactly the same manner as was the case with their
smaller predecessors whom they had wiped out because of their
peace-disturbing quarrelsomeness. Once their acquisitions were properly
digested, they looked again beyond their boundaries for outlets of their
energies-and a new cycle of wars began, wars, however, that were
qualitatively different from the earlier ones.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-4">[…]</p>

  <p id="paragraph-5">They occurred at longer intervals than the medieval wars. This is why we are
often deluded into thinking that the pacification of large regions and their
organization as great powers was beneficial to mankind after all. Even if
wars were not completely eliminated, their number was greatly reduced. But
it is not the quantity that matters. It is the quality that counts.</p>

<p id="paragraph-7">~ forest management &amp; fire suppression practices. Small, controlled burns can
be beneficial in clearing out dead wood while doing little harm to living
tress, and allowing for forests to regenerate. Suppressing fires absolutely
(e.g. to protect property at all costs) has the potential of letting fuel
build up over time, increasing the risks of megafires that kill even the living
trees and lay waste to the entire forest in the end.</p>
