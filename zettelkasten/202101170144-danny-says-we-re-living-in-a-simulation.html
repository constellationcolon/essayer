  <p id="paragraph-0">The first time I came across Curtis’ thesis in HyperNormalisation [<a class="citation" href="#hypernormalisation">Curtis, 2016</a>], I thought he’d gone off the deep end. He claims that,
starting in the 70’s, politicians and capitalists have given up on the
messiness of the real world and have instead substituted and sustained a
simpler world of their own design. I’d deeply admired Century of the Self [<a class="citation" href="#century-of-the-self">Curtis, 2002</a>], but HyperNormalisation just came across like a
basket of conspiracy theories cobbled together and served up as social
critique.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">I was also reading Baudrillard’s <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em> [<a class="citation" href="#simulacra-and-simulation">Baudrillard, 1981</a>] around the same time and found myself, again,
irked by puffery. This time, it was from the gratuitous application of terms
borrowed from technical fields [<a class="citation" href="#citation-needed"><i>Citation Needed</i>, n.d.</a>], which seemed to
aim more at creating an <em>impression</em> of scientific technique than at
conducting any sort of rigorous analysis of modern scientific technique / its
effects in social reality (possibly cf: [<a class="citation" href="#plastic-words">Pörksen, 2004</a>]). I would
not be surprised, however, if this was a deliberate (if annoying) stylistic
choice in service of advancing his “post-modern” argument.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p id="paragraph-2">I will concede in both cases, however, that there is probably a tiny kernel of
truth buried deep, deep underneath the overburden of pretentious terms and
over-exaggeration. We humans rely on models of the world in order to be able
to live effectively in it. There is not such a thing as an un-mediated
reality, and our representations of the world become less discerning as the
horizon we have to deal with expands outwards (the analysis in <em>Public
Opinion</em> [<a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">Lippmann, 1922</a>] comes in useful here).</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">On the state level, such representations—of people, of resources—have to be
systematised in a grid of the state’s making in order to make <em>legible</em>
everything within its confines, to levy taxes and effect conscription (so as
to wage wars). The aspects of the world that appear on such representations
(e.g. census, cadastral surveys, maps) are highly restricted, privileging
those that are of interest to the state, regardless of the fidelity of such
representations to the lived reality of the everyperson. [<a class="citation" href="#seeing-like-a-state">Scott, 1998</a>]</p>

<p id="paragraph-4">This reductionist tendency is one I have observed in practice of data science.
As a younger data scientist, I was baffled whenever more senior colleagues
would reach automatically for the absolute simplest tools—linear regression,
logistic regression, those techniques you learn about in the first week of
introductory machine learning—when conducting analyses of business data. There
are so many models out there that would be able to give us much more accurate
predictions, so why are we still sticking to these dinky little elementary
tools?</p>

<p id="paragraph-5">Well, I soon learned that outside the confines of academia, people cared very
much about the interpretability of such models, often over and above the error
metrics academicians so emphasized. People wanted to know more about <em>why</em> the
model made a certain prediction—for example, why did the model predict that
this customer would keep their subscription, and that one would churn? Knowing
the why would enable the business to take action, for example, by ameliorating
whatever the root causes of customer churn was.</p>

<p id="paragraph-6">On the other hand, complex models, while usually more accurate, were less
interpretable, with fewer easy explanations of “X factor increases Y outcome”.
This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonini%27s_paradox">Bonini’s paradox</a>, summed up nicely in <em>The
Breakdown of Nations</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-7">Oblivious of their own inconsistency, some of our modernists point out that
small states had an easier time of it, being so insignificant in size and
population. But this is exactly it! Because they were small, they could not
only solve their problems better than their large counterparts; they could
do so without the assistance of such brilliant minds as Marx, Schacht,
Cripps, or Keynes. They did not need to deal with aggregates which, in large
countries, even statisticians can only guess, and whose meaning even experts
do not always understand. They could at all times see their economy at their
feet—open, surveyable, manageable. They did not need to operate on
assumptions which no one on earth can prove, however great his learning and
many his degrees.</p>

  <p class="attribution" id="paragraph-8"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 152</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-9">Such analyses was not only less actionable to people around the company, they
can also be perceived as being less trustworthy—nobody likes a black box with
the potential of yielding arbitrarily wild predictions. And so the simplest of
models have stayed fast in the toolboxes of data scientists through the years,
despite the inadequacy of such simple tools and explanations for the task of
modelling the large complex world we find ourselves having to deal with, and
despite all the recent advances and hype surrounding deep learning.</p>

<p id="paragraph-10">The attitude I’ve just described—the preference for interpretability over
accuracy—sits, in some odd ways, on the enlightened end of the spectrum. More
insidious is when people unquestioningly hail the application of such models
as some magical silver bullet. This applies to all models, and not just those
over-hyped specimens from the AI/ML world.</p>

<p id="paragraph-11">“All models are wrong, but some are useful,” is an adage I wish more people
understood. I’d also hasten to add, “in limited contexts.” Oft quoted is the
George Box version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-12">… all models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but
some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always
be borne in mind….</p>

  <p id="paragraph-13">George Box</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-14">Timely and germane is the example of how <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/west-coast-california-wildfire-infernos/">wildfires have been handled in
California</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-15">Firefighters used a model of fire spread that worked only under certain
assumptions of “light surface fuel” which failed as fuel loads in forests
built up over time due to fire suppression policies</p>

  <p id="paragraph-16">Flammable as it looked, even forests mismanaged like that patch burned until
recently in the historical way, at low severity along the forest floor. As a
result, the entire field of wildfire science—including every modeling tool
with which firefighters make life-or-death decisions and society structures
itself in fire-prone areas—is based on that kind of fire behavior. The core
mathematics of this science date to the early 1970s, when a Forest Service
researcher named Richard Rothermel used small laboratory fires to produce
equations expressing the relationship between wind speed, ground slope, and
how fast a fire spreads. Rothermel knew his approach worked properly only
for wildfire in light surface fuel like that in his lab—and failed to
capture what happened when blazes got into treetops and jumped
crown-to-crown. But these so-called Rothermel spread equations were
applicable to so many wildfires that the Forest Service quickly developed
paper-and-pencil ways for firefighters to plug in numbers for wind and slope
angle and make reasonable guesses about how fast and in which direction a
fire might spread—in a single heading, on a straight line. Eventually that
modeling framework was run on cumbersome supercomputers, then on handheld
calculators. In the early 1990s, PC-based software finally allowed
firefighters to predict fire spread in two dimensions on a map.</p>

  <li>Modellers usually know the limitations of their models up front—any model
requires the acceptance of certain assumptions, the negligence of certain
terms. Such limitations need to be communicated clearly, especially to
non-technical end-users, lest the model be over-extended in its
application. Sometimes, though, when a model becomes <em>too</em> useful, it is
no longer within the control of the modeller as to where it gets
applied—and that’s where the trouble starts.</li>
  <li>There is an understandable, if sometimes damnable universalising tendency
that undergirds our culture. All models are built on certain sets of
assumptions, assumptions that are inevitably an encoding of the modeller’s
own culture and experiences. Even in physics—the models we developed
first, and indeed are the most sure of, are those of the space- and
time-scales that we humans have the most direct experience of. To deny the
limited applicability of models (and especially those outside of the
“hard” sciences) takes ignorance, arrogance, avarice, sloth, or some
combination thereof. In California, as in Australia, the accumulated
wisdom of the natives in managing their dry and fire-prone homelands was
ignored in favour of the forest management techniques the colonizing
Europeans brought from their comparatively wetter climes, to horrifying
consequences.</li>
</ol>

<p id="paragraph-17">And so, from Curtis: yes, state and bureaucratic machinations necessitate
simplifying assumptions for their efficient workings. It doesn’t mean there is
a grand conspiracy starting only in the 70’s that’s engulfed us all today; if
anything, we’ve been hypernormalised since the birth of the state. Possibly
before. From Baudrillard: what he calls the precession of simulacra, I call the
precession of models.</p>
