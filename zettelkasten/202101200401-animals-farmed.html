  <div class="main-text">
  <p id="paragraph-0"><em>The Guardian</em> has a series called “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/animals-farmed">Animals Farmed</a>” that talks about the
fallout from our insatiable appetite for cheap meat, from the intensive farming
industry that feeds it.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">A nod to <em>Animal Farm</em> [<a class="citation" href="#animal-farm">Orwell, 1945</a>], in which the pigs, leaders of
the communist animals, are finally revealed to be no different than the
capitalist humans they had rebelled against in the first place.</p>

<p id="paragraph-2">The metaphor cuts deep. Possibly deeper than Orwell himself first intended.
For to look directly at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/04/one-thing-ive-learned-about-modern-farming-we-shouldnt-do-it-like-this">graphic inhumanity of modern
farming</a> is, disconcertingly, but to look into a mirror
of our own lives.</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">From the inimitable Radiohead: [<a class="citation" href="#fitter-happier">Radiohead, 1997</a>]</p>
<verse>
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
...
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics
</verse>

<p id="paragraph-4">And the slightly more prosaic: [<a class="citation" href="#animals-territory-metamorphoses">Baudrillard, 1981</a>]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-5">Animals have thus preceded us on the path of liberal extermination. All the
aspects of the modern treatment of animals retrace the vicissitudes of the
manipulation of humans, from experimentation to industrial pressure in
breeding.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-6">…</p>

  <p id="paragraph-7">One has never said better how much “humanism,” “normality,” “quality of
life” were nothing but the vicissitudes of profitability. The parallel
between these animals sick from surplus value and humans sick from
industrial concentration, from the scientific organization of work and
assembly-line factories is illuminating. In the latter case as well, the
capitalist “breeders” were led to a revision that was destructive of the
mode of exploitation, innovating and reinventing the “quality of work,” the
“enrichment of tasks,” discovering the “human” sciences and the
“psychosociological” dimension of the factory. Only the inevitability of
death renders the example of the animals more shocking still than that of
men on an assembly line.</p>
</blockquote>

during animal transport has caused such stress to piglets they start biting
each other’s tails off, and some pigs have evolved to have shorter / no tail.</p>
