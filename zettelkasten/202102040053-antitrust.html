    <p id="paragraph-0">So our legislators have never ceased studying the question of how to cut
down their size. But the simplest method, instead of enacting futile
prohibitions, would have been to establish the small-state or federal
principle, which has succeeded so superbly politically, also economically.
With all economic power of a private nature, and serving private purposes,
ending at the state boundaries, the monster of size would vanish by itself.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">Kohr: limit corporations to within state boundaries</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="quote">
    <p id="paragraph-2">Indeed, there is no misery on earth that cannot be successfully handled on a
small scale as, conversely, there is no misery on earth that can be handled
at all except on a small scale. In vastness, everything crumbles, even the
good, because, as will increasingly become evident, the world’s one and only
problem is not wickedness but bigness; and not the thing that is big,
whatever it may be, but bigness itself. […] Yet all our collectivized and
collectivizing efforts seem to be directed towards this one fantastic
goal-unification. Which, of course, is a solution, too. The solution of
spontaneous collapse.</p>
