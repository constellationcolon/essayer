  <p id="paragraph-0">Successful federations have “enforceable executive authority” (p. 177)</p>

<ol>
  <li>federal must be slightly stronger than its strongest member</li>
  <li>members relatively homogeneous in size
    <ul>
      <li>else the strongest members will refuse to contribute to federal organ
that can overshadow themselves</li>
      <li>smaller member states must be able to stand together against the bigger</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-1">And the small member states could not conceivably make up for the deficiency
of the big. Hence the pathetic emphasis of large-power unions such as the
United Nations or the European Council on good will. But good will has no
executive authority, and without executive authority no political organism
can exist. As a result, large-power unions are able to live only by the
grace of their large members who can, and do, veto them out of existence at
will.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-2">[…]</p>

  <p id="paragraph-3">As a result, if we are interested in creating international unions not only
effectively but also economically, peacefully, and democratically, we must
fall back on the organizational principle which alone contains the secret of
success, the small-cell principle, and apply the curative principle of
division to every federal structure containing big powers.</p>
