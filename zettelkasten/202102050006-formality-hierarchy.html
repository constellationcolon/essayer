  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-0">Mystification of rulers in mass society</p>

  <p id="paragraph-1">The rulers of a small state, if they can be called that, are the citizen’s
neighbours. Since he knows them closely, they will never be able to hide
themselves in mysterious shrouds under whose cover they might take on the
dim and aloof appearance of supermen.</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">~ <a class="citation" href="#ancient-futures">Norberg-Hodge, 1991/2016</a> re: casual interactions between rulers &amp; ruled
in Ladakh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="tldr" id="paragraph-4">Citizens of small principalities can easily seek a personal audience with
their prince; not so much a citizen of the United States, who’d sooner be
arrested by the Secret Service</p>

  <p id="paragraph-5">A citizen of the Principality of Liechtenstein, whose population numbers
less than fourteen thousand, desirous to see His Serene Highness the Prince
and Sovereign, Bearer of many exalted orders and Defender of many exalted
things, can do so by ringing the bell at his castle gate. However serene His
Highness may be, he is never an inaccessible stranger. A citizen of the
massive American republic, on the other hand, encounters untold obstacles in
a similar enterprise. Trying to see his fellow citizen President, whose
function is to be his servant, not his master, he may be sent to an insane
asylum for observation or, if found sane, to a court on charges of
disorderly conduct. Both happened in 1950. In 1951, a citizen spent $1,800
in eleven months in an effort ‘to get the President’s attention”-in vain.
You will say that in a large power such as the United States informal
relationships such as exist between government and citizen in small
countries are technically unfeasible. This is quite true. But this is
exactly it. Democracy in its full meaning is impossible in a large state
which, as Aristotle already observed, is ‘almost incapable of constitutional
government.</p>
