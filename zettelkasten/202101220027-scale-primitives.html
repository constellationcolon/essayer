<p id="paragraph-0">Despite all the hype surrounding “scale” today from SV, it seems to be a
civilisational instinct that’s been with us since the earliest states,
playing itself out on larger and larger stages over the ages.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1"><strong>Agriculture as the first multiplier</strong> the imperative of primitive warfare,
“more people =&gt; more wars won”, throwing in a dash of avarice and hubris,
encouraged the formation of permanent agricultural settlements. Although
agriculture is less efficient per person (vs hunting-gathering), it is more
efficient per land area, hence more accessible from a state nucleus. The
concentration within a small, reachable area, along with the relative
permanance of the cultivated land, meant that agricultural products were more
easily appropriated by the state (i.e. taxed). [<a class="citation" href="#the-art-of-not-being-governed">Scott, 2009</a>]. With the agricultural base, it was then
possible to provide the food and the manpower needed for waging more
devastating, and successful wars.</p>

<p id="paragraph-2"><strong>(State) Warfare, the great anonymiser</strong> universal currencies—coinage—became
important only between strangers. Credit systems were much more common within
communities and between neighbours. Encounters between friendly travellers and
locals were left to the arts of hospitality. But encounters between hostile
strangers (e.g. soldiers passing through) and locals—necessitated a form of
one-and-done exchange facilitated via a universal, interchangeable currency:
cold, hard cash. [<a class="citation" href="#debt">Graeber, 2011</a>]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-3">“War is a collectivizing process, and large-scale collectivism is
inherently warlike. If not militarist by nationai tradition, highly
centralized states must become so by the very necessity of sustaining at
home an inordinate, “unnatural” power concentration, by the threat of
their governmental mobilization as felt by other nations, and by their
almost inevitable transformation of commercial intercourse into organized
economic warfare among great economic-political blocs. There can be no
real peace or solid world order in a world of a few great, centralized
powers.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-5">With our dependence on massive existence for individual survival, every
occupation disposing of a multiplying element becomes important on that
account alone, while quality ceases to be a criterion of value altogether.</p>

  <p class="attribution" id="paragraph-6"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 119</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-7">Here’s the rub: at every stage of the development of “civilisation”, we’ve
told ourselves the story that more manpower = better future for all. This is a
lie. This is the very first lie in the series of lies that transmuted quantity
into quality. More manpower in the early states meant more soldiers and
conscripts with which to wage war… not exactly the ideal situation to be
drawn into. The acquisition of more land in that process meant an expanded
agricultural operation, which enabled ever larger, denser populations, putting
strains on resources (=&gt; the invention of scarcity) and creating problems that
arise only in unnaturally crowded conditions, e.g. pandemics.</p>

<p id="paragraph-8">Today, this population growth ideology manifests itself in the “pro-life”
rhetoric, which strives to protect the increment of human beings on the planet
and turns angrily away at the mere mention of helping improve their lives once
they are born. It manifests in the anti-abortion preachings of Western
missionaries abroad, which then, ironically, sets off a Malthusian panic in
the developed world when it realises that all these people in the “Global
South” would too, like to attain the living standards of the developed
middle-class—yet another pipe dream sold to them by the IMF and the World
Bank. It manifests in the rhetoric of economic growth, which for small
city-states like Singapore apparently means growth in population without end,
through pro-natalist government policy or through pro-immigration policies,
without regard for the living standards of the citizens already living on a
crowded island, for the consequences of unabating growth (in consumption and
extraction) on an already straining planet, for the rights of the workers from
the “less fortunate countries” who get chewed up in the hierarchies in the
global pecking order when they take up exploitative and coercive jobs that the
“locals didn’t want”, precisely because those jobs don’t pay fair wages.</p>
