  <p id="paragraph-0">This is the perfect storm of mis-aligned 21st century incentives:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p id="paragraph-1"><strong>A planetary-scale disaster unfolding in slow motion,</strong> with little of
the quick or easy visual- or sound-bites so suited our attention-deficient
consciousnesses. One can only show a hockey stick graph so many times, and
images of polar bears seem impossibly far removed. With the Cold War, it
was at least easy for the average person to immediately comprehend the
consequences of a misstep: a mushroom cloud, and then—nothing. While there
are (sadly) certainly more examples at hand today that are well suited for
the news cycle (e.g. the orange-red skies of the Australian and
Californian wildfires this year), how many news outlets are actually
drawing those links between these tragedies and the consequences of our
actions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p id="paragraph-2"><strong>“Climate change is a ratings killer” — Chris Hayes</strong> The climate crisis
is undoubtedly a story that begins with our poor life choices, and can
only end when we collectively acknowledge and re-evaluate them. Too often,
this re-evaluation is cast as teeth-pulling (reducing consumption on all
fronts, portrayed as painful despite the spiritual hollowness of modern
consumer culture), individual consumer choice (paying more for renewable
energy—a patent lie now that renewables are actually cheaper than fossil
fuels) and political gridlock (COPXX; no further comment here).
This has had the effect of turning viewers off, a no-no for any
advertising-based business whose primary KPI is engagement. Some
believe this is primarily because these programmes have tended to be
<a href="https://grist.org/article/is-climate-change-a-ratings-killer-or-is-something-wrong-with-for-profit-media/">presented poorly</a>. Others believe it to be too
depressing—but this begs the question of how such a crisis can be more
depressing than the endless parade of wars in the Middle East on show in
the mass media? In the grand scheme of things, far too few outlets
recognise this as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/22/why-is-the-us-news-media-so-bad-at-covering-climate-change">opportunity to rebuild</a> our economies
in a way that is more just and equitable for people and living beings all
across this Earth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p id="paragraph-3"><strong>Politically sensitive implications</strong> The climate crisis is almost
certainly going to bring more climate refugees to the doorsteps of other
cities, states, and nations as time goes on; the climate migrations have
already started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p id="paragraph-4"><strong>Ideologically sensitive implications</strong> At the heart of it, the climate
crisis is a story about the consequences of greed, of the lie of infinite
economic growth on a finite planet. We’ve lived with this story for so
long—so many, like I, was brought up on it, spoon-fed to us as
school-children—that we’ve forgotten that it was just a story of hope we
told ourselves in an age when we were so small in number as to be
negligible on this planet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p id="paragraph-5"><a href="/essayer/zettelkasten/202101220222-compassion-fatigue"><strong>Compassion fatigue</strong></a> Even for the most
compassionate amongst us, the daily onslaught of Things Wrong With The
World can induce a paradoxical apathy, from just having too many things to
care about at once that we shut down as a coping mechanism.</p>
