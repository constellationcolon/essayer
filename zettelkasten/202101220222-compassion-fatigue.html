<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-0">the degree of human disapproval, the philosophy of censure, reveals a
proportionate and equally natural tendency to decline. Were this not so, the
experience of witnessing mounting misery would soon overtax our compassion
and kill us. In fact, the greater our decency and ability for compassion,
the faster we would succumb.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-2">But once we broaden our scope to regions beyond the horizon, and extend our
affections to vast multitudes such as nations or humanity, everything begins
to elude our grasp. What was ours in our ponds has been lost in the oceans,
and our previously undisturbed emotions are now forever subject to the
disturbances occurring on these vaster scales at every moment. In our
villages, there may be an upsetting murder once in a decade. The rest of the
time we live in unruffled peace. In a large community, on the other hand,
there is murder, rape, and robbery every hour in some distant corner. But
since we are linked with every distant corner, every local incident turns
into an issue, a cause, a national calamity clouding our skies not once in a
decade but all the time. From our local newspapers we learn that none of the
massive misfortunes depressing the world ever happens in our own town. Yet,
we must suffer because our unifiers have forced us to participate in
millions of destinies that are not ours. This is the price of modern
vast-scale living. Having drawn the entire human race to our anxious bosom,
we have to share in all its miseries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-4">But what are issues? Sparks kindled by some spontaneous combustion of ends
and flitting aimlessly through people’s brains which act as involuntary
conductors because in modern crowd life we stand too closely together to
escape infection. They are uncontrollable phenomena of large-scale existence,
transmitting themselves across the entire surface of the globe and creating
the necessity in those they brush of participating intellectually in whatever
movement may arise in whatever corner of whatever continent. […] In the
intellectual oneness of our world community, we react to every force like
the interlocked springs in those old mattresses. Even if we are not
immediately touched, we are depressed by them. Every damn thing in this
world has become everybody’s issue.</p>

<p id="paragraph-7">This is also as much a function of the profit motives of the media environment
as the scale of the society it operates in (and they operate in lockstep).

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-8">A small-state world, by dividing our universal, permanent, impersonal
miseries into small, discontinuous, and personal incidents, thus return us
from the misty sombreness of an existence in which we are nothing but
ghostly shadows; of meaningless issues, to the bliss of reality which we can
find only in our neighbours and our neighbourhoods. There alone, love is
love, and sex is sex, and passion is passion. If we hate a man, it is not
because he is a communist but because he is nasty, and if we love him it is
not because he is a patriot but because he is a gentleman. In neighbourhoods
everything becomes part of our personal experience. Nothing remains an
impersonal issue.</p>
