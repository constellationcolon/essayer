<p id="paragraph-0">Drawing on Blackstone, private property was “assigned” to people for the “grand ends of civil society, the peace and security of individuals”, having
duties as well as rights due to ownership.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-1">Absolute private property inevitably produced intolerable evils. Absolute
owners did grave damage to their neighbors and to their descendants: they
ruined the fertility, of the land, they exploited destructively the
minerals under the surface, they burned and cut forests, they destroyed
the wild life, they polluted streams, they cornered supplies and formed
monopolies, they held land and resources out of use, they exploited the
feeble bargaining power of wage earners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-2">Contra Blackstone (and supposedly the traditions of “Western civility”),
political theorists conceived of private property as an absolute right,
without its attendant duties that were its justification. So when such evils
arose there was nothing in political philosophy or jurisprudence to counter
them. “They had lost the tradition that property is the creation of the law for social purposes.”</p>

<h1 id="on-the-public">On the “public”</h1>
