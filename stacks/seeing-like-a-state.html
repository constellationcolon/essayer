<h2 id="on-surnames--the-state">On Surnames &amp; the State</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-1">The invention of permanent, inherited patronyms was, after the
administrative simplification of nature (for example, the forest) and space
(for example, land tenure), the last step in establishing the necessary
preconditions of modern statecraft. In almost every case it was a state
project, designed to allow officials to identify, unambiguously, the
majority of its citizens. When successful, it went far to create a legible
people.38 Tax and tithe rolls, property rolls, conscription lists, censuses,
and property deeds recognized in law were inconceivable without some means
of fixing an individual’s identity and linking him or her to a kin group.
Campaigns to assign permanent patronyms have typically taken place, as one
might expect, in the context of a state’s exertions to put its fiscal system
on a sounder and more lucrative footing. Fearing, with good reason, that an
effort to enumerate and register them could be a prelude to some new tax
burden or conscription, local officials and the population at large often
resisted such campaigns.</p>

<p id="paragraph-2">An interesting account of the origins of the term 老百姓—usually denoting “the
common people”, but literally means the Classic Hundred Surnames.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-3">If permanent surnames were largely a project of official legibility, then
they should have appeared earliest in those societies with precocious
states. China provides a striking example.39 By roughly the fourth century
B.C. (although the exact timing and comprehensiveness are in dispute), the
Qin dynasty had apparently begun imposing surnames on much of its population
and enumerating them for the purposes of taxes, forced labor, and
conscription.40 This initiative may well have been the origin of the term
“laobaixing,” meaning, literally, “the old one hundred surnames,” which in
modern China has come to mean “the common people.” Before this, the fabled
Chinese patrilineage, while established among ruling houses and related
lines, was absent among commoners. They did not have surnames, nor did they
even imitate elite practices in this respect. The assigning of patronyms by
family was integral to state policy promoting the status of (male) family
heads, giving them legal jurisdiction over their wives, children, and
juniors and, not incidentally, holding them accountable for the fiscal
obligations of the entire family.41 This (Qin) policy required registering
the entire population, after which the “hodgepodge of terms by which people
were called were all classified as hsing [surname], to be passed down to
their patrilineal descendants indefinitely.”42 On this account, both the
establishment of permanent patronyms and the creation of the patrilineal
family itself can be attributed to early state simplification.</p>
