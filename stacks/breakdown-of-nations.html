<title>The Breakdown of Nations</title>

<div class="essai stacks">

<div id="title">The Breakdown of Nations</div>
<div id="author"><span>Kohr, Leopold</span></div>

<div class="main-text">

<p id="paragraph-0">A classic book, with wide-ranging implications for how we structure our
communities and societies. Its conclusions have held up remarkably well over
the years, and continues to be incredibly relevant to our current state of
over-extended affairs (e.g. <span class="small-caps">US</span> imperialism,
Brexit, climate change, tech anti-trust, etc. etc.). It upended my thinking on
the uses of “unity” and “size” for purposes of peace (cf <a href="/essayer/zettelkasten/202102030550-wars-and-unions">Wars &amp; Unions</a>).</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">If you were looking for solutions to the problems of scale, Kohr does suggest
a few. If you were looking for optimism about the fate of the human race,
however, I’d strongly suggest you look elsewhere (though that does not prevent
me from recommending it, so endearing is his expression of nihilism).</p>

<h2 id="unkastened-notes">Unkastened Notes</h2>

<p id="paragraph-3">I find it a little ironic that a book about how “smaller nations are better”
opens with this grand claim that he’s going to propose herein one single
social model to rule them all. I suppose even he couldn’t help but get caught
up in the hard-science envy of the day.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-4"><label for="toggle-marginnote-1" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-1" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-1" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. xviii</a></span>
As the physicists of our time have tried to elaborate an integrated single
theory, capable of explaining not only some but all phenomena of
the physical universe, so I have tried on a different plane to develop a
single theory through which not only some but all phenomena of the
social universe can be reduced to a common denominator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-5">So much Orientalism on page 9:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-6">It is the face of Michelangelo we see in Saint Peter’s Basilica, not that of
 the Italian people which put the marble in its place. This is the main
 difference from the massive accumulations of stone built in Egypt not by
 men but a dis-individualized society which, characteristically, poured
 most of its creative energy into the construction of tombs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-7">Also some uses of “mongoloid” as an adjective + questionable stances on
feminism, hence my content warning.</p>

<h3 id="homologies-not-analogies">“Homologies”, not “analogies”</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-8"><label for="toggle-marginnote-2" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-2" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-2" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, pp. 84–5</a></span></p>

  <p id="paragraph-9">Sir George Thomson has described the phenomenon of the instability and
self-destructiveness of bigness in an analogy which is all the more
interesting as it tries to illustrate a physical process by drawing a
comparison from the political field as this book tries to illustrate a
political process by drawing a comparison from the physical field:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p id="paragraph-10">Atoms of middle weight are stable and inert, but the light as well as the
heavy atoms have stores of energy. If one thinks of the heaviest atoms as
overgrown empires which are ripe for dissolution and only held together by
special efforts, or perhaps by a genius, one may think, on the other hand,
of the lightest of the atoms as individuals which run together naturally
for mutual help and readily coalesce to form stable tribes and
communities.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p id="paragraph-11">It is always the same revelation: only small things, be they atoms,
individuals, or communities, can be combined in search of a more stable
existence, and even they will coalesce <em>naturally</em> only up to a point.
Beyond that, what previously helped to fulfil their form, now bursts it,
with the result that, as they continue to grow, they become heavier and
clumsier until the only thing they do naturally is—fall apart. This is why
neither Sir George Thomson’s political nor my physical comparisons are
really analogies. They are homologies. They are two different manifestations
of one and the same principle: the universal principle by which stability
and soundness adhere only to bodies of middle weight or, to put emphasis
where it belongs, to bodies that are relatively small.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-12">What’s the “half-life” of an over-large society?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-13"><label for="toggle-marginnote-3" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-3" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-3" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 112</a></span>
Crushed by the intellect-killing but emotionally appealing weight of great
physical power, they have drawn their scornful daggers against the small and
placed everything that has size, bulk, or mass on glittering altars. They
have persuaded us to worship the colossal and then were amazed that we
worshipped Hitler who was nothing-but he was colossal. They have praised to
the heavens the enormity of the Roman empire and were amazed that we
worshipped Mussolini along with the ancient Caesars who were nothing-but
they were enormous. They have praised the development of massive powers, of
the unification of East and West, of the creation of first two worlds and,
finally, glory of glories if it comes, of the one world, though the
one-state world is nothing but totalitarianism projected into the
international plane.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-14">They cannot see that the great word unity, which they pronounce with such
solemnity and preach down to us from every pulpit,
<label for="toggle-hidden-sidenote-1" class="hidden-sidenote-label"><input id="toggle-hidden-sidenote-1" class="hidden-sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="hidden-sidenote-1" class="hidden-sidenote"><img src="/essayer/assets/images/press-boot-own-head.jpg"></span>is to a true democrat what to a boxer’s eye is his adversary’s fist</label>.
If driven too far, it not only destroys the individual but the state as
well, […]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="producer-goods">“Producer goods”</h3>

<p id="paragraph-15">Large-scale manufacturing gives us “producer goods” e.g. factories “which
satisfy no direct human want but have become necessary in order to enable us
to meet our increasing requirements for essentials.” <a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 134</a></p>

<h3 id="size-theory-of-business-cycles">Size theory of business cycles</h3>

<p id="paragraph-16">p. 147</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Power commodities</strong> “tanks, bombs, or the increase in government services
required to administer increased power.”</li>
  <li>
<strong>Density commodities</strong> “traffic lights, first-aid equipment, tube services,
or replacement goods for losses which would never have occurred in less
harassed smaller societies.”</li>
  <li>
<strong>Progress commodities</strong> arms race conditions: anti-aircraft guns must be
improved to match improved aircraft and so on, “<em>unwanted</em> tie-in products
we must acquire along with the desired fruit of progress”.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-17"><label for="toggle-marginnote-4" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-4" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-4" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 147</a></span>
The bulk of the vaunted production and productivity increase experienced by
today’s great powers goes into these personally sterile but socially
necessary growth commodities. It raises not our real but our bogus standard
of living by giving us the illusion of increasing wealth while, like
currency in inflation, it amounts to nothing but an enormous increase in the
price and effort an expanding society imposes on us for giving us the goods
we really desire.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-18"><label for="toggle-marginnote-5" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-5" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-5" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 149</a></span>
It is inability, the plain sheer unadulterated inability of man to cope with
the problems of societies that have grown too large. What Thomas Malthus
said of the relationship between food and population—that the population
must outrun its food supply because of its tendency to multiply at a
geometric ratio while the latter increases only at an arithmetic ratio—is
true also of the relation between human talent and the problems of size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="in-favour-of-co-ops">In favour of co-ops</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-19"><label for="toggle-marginnote-6" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-6" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-6" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 153</a></span>
Since the consequences of economic behaviour can be foreseen only in units
that are small, the smallness of the economic complex is not an accidental
but the most fundamental characteristic of cooperative concepts. It excludes
gigantomania by constitution, as early capitalism excluded it by
competition.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="boundaries-not-barriers">Boundaries, not barriers</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-20"><label for="toggle-marginnote-7" class="marginnote-symbol">✥</label><input id="toggle-marginnote-7" class="marginnote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="marginnote-7" class="marginnote"><a class="citation" href="#breakdown-of-nations">Kohr, 1957/1978, p. 167</a></span>
It is this spectre of the restoration of boundaries which seems to hold such
terrors to our unification theorists, but only because they cannot visualize
that boundaries do not necessarily mean barriers and that, without the
connotation of barrier, they are the source of our happiness, not of our
misery.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-it-be-done-the-breakdown-of-nations">(How) Can it be done, the breakdown of nations?</h3>

  <li>war</li>
  <li>proportional representation in a federal union (oh boy… population wars)</li>
