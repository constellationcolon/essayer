<div class="main-text">

<p id="paragraph-0">I have only one complaint about this fantastic story, and it is this: the
library is claimed to be infinite, and to contain all possible books it is
possible to ever print, each distinct from any other. But for a given alphabet
with finite symbols, printed on books of uniform and finite dimensions, using
typefaces of uniform and non-negligible size (to facilitate reading, duh), fit
onto bookshelves of standard and finite size, there can exist only an finite,
and indeed enumerable number of unique books. The number would be big,
mind-bogglingly big, but nowhere near infinite. But perhaps the narrator did
hedge against this fallacy of the infinite by speculating about whether the
library wrapped around itself, so as to give the impression of limitlessness,
when its explorers are just wandering around in endless circles.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">That is all.</p>
