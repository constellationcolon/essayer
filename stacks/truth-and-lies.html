Let us think in particular of the formation of concepts. Every word becomes a
concept as soon as it is supposed to serve not merely as a reminder of the
unique, absolutely individualized original experience, to which it owes
its origin, but at the same time to fit countless, more or less similar
cases, which, strictly speaking, are never identical, and hence absolutely
dissimilar. Every concept originates by the equation of the dissimilar.</p>

What is truth? a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in
short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically
heightened, transferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid,
canonical, and binding to a nation. Truths are illusions about which it has
been forgotten that they are illusions, worn-out metaphors without sensory
impact, coins which have lost their image and now can be used only as metal,
and no longer as coins.</p>

As a “rational” being, he now puts his actions under the rule of
abstractions; he no longer lets himself be carried away by sudden
impressions, by intuitions; he first universalizes these impressions into
less colorful, cooler concepts, in order to hitch the wagon of his life and
actions to them. Everything that sets man off from the animal depends upon
this capacity to dilute the concrete metaphors into a schema; for in the
realm of such schemata, something is possible that might never succeed under
the intuited first impressions: to build up a pyramidal order according to
castes and classes, a new world of laws, privileges, subordinations,
boundary determinations, which now stands opposite the other, concrete world
of primary impressions, as the more solid, more universal, more familiar,
more human, and therefore as the regulatory and imperative world.</p>

As the Romans and Etruscans carved up the sky into rigid mathematical
sectors and assigned a god to each delimited space as in a temple, so every
nation has such a mathematically divided conceptual sky above it and
understands by the demand for truth that each conceptual god must be sought
only in his own sphere. In this respect man can probably be admired as a
mighty architectural genius who succeeds in building an infinitely
complicated conceptual cathedral on foundations that move like flowing
water; of course, in order to anchor itself to such a foundation, the
building must be light as gossamer-delicate enough to be carried along by
the wave, yet strong enough not to be blown apart by the wind.</p>

Language, as we saw, and later science, works at the structure of concepts.
As the bee simultaneously builds the cells and fills them . with honey, so
science works incessantly at the great columbarium of the concepts, the
sepulcher of intuition, forever constructing new and ever higher levels,
buttressing, cleaning, renovating old cells, and striving especially to
fill this enormous towering edifice and to arrange the whole empirical,
i.e., anthropomorphic, world in it.</p>

That enormous structure of beams and boards of the concepts, to which the
poor man clings for dear life, is for the liberated intellect just a
scaffolding and plaything for his boldest artifices. And when he smashes it
apart, scattering it, and then ironically puts it together again, joining
the most remote and separating what is closest, he reveals that he does not
need the emergency aid of poverty, and that he is now guided not by concepts
but by intuitions. From these intuitions no regular road leads to the land
of ghostly schemata, of abstractions. The word is not made for these
intuitions; man falls silent when he sees them, or he speaks in sheer
forbidden metaphors and unheard of conceptual compounds, in order at least
by smashing and scorning the old conceptual barricades to correspond
creatively to the impressions of the mighty present intuition.</p>
