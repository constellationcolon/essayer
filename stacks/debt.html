<div id="author"><span>Graeber, David</span></div>

<div class="main-text">

<p id="paragraph-0">So much tea packed into one book.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1"><em>The <span class="small-caps">TL;DR</span> on the “third-world debt crisis”</em> you hear from time to
time (but whose origins never get explained): the <span class="small-caps">OPEC</span> had a glut of
money lying around from the oil crisis in the 70’s, and deposited it in
Western banks. Western banks now had a glut of money they wanted to get
interest on, so they teamed up with the <span class="small-caps">IMF</span> / World Bank and started
offering “development loans” to “developing” countries, agreed upon by the
ruling elites of those countries. That borrowed money didn’t exactly trickle
down to the ordinary people in those countries, but it was still ultimately
the ordinary people who had to repay the principal + interest on those loans
via taxes (surprise, surprise). The net effect being that the outflow of money
from the poorer countries to the rich was actually larger than the inflow,
i.e. the poorer countries of the world were technically, all told, sending
financial aid to the richer countries(’ financial elites).</p>

<p id="paragraph-2"><em>The origin myth of money</em> (i.e. that tale they told you about primitives
wanting to barter but not having things of equal value to exchange on hand)
was pretty much a fabrication by Adam Smith et al. They were trying to justify
instituting economics as its own field of study, supposedly prior to and hence
independent from politics or ethics.</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">In fact, <em>Smith’s famous “invisible hand”, as well as the anecdote about the
pin factory, both appear to have been <del>lifted</del></em> uh, <em>inspired</em> by earlier
sources in Islamic philosophy that reached European audiences during the
Enlightenment. (In addition to other such derivative works by Descartes, Hume,
and Kant.)</p>

<p id="paragraph-4"><em>Credit as a concept existed before money ever did</em>, often as a way of
arranging social relations within a community.</p>

<p id="paragraph-5">There used to be regular <em>“debt-forgiveness decrees”</em> e.g. in Egypt, where
during a debt crisis, everyone’s debts, then recorded on tablets, would get
erased, and the tablets broken. Everyone would get to start over, literally on
a clean slate. The Rosetta Stone—so famous for its key role in the translation
of texts—is actually a record of such a decree by Ptolemy V.</p>

<p id="paragraph-6"><em>Money (specifically, coinage) only became important in conjunction with
warfare</em>, whereas credit was more widely used amongst civilians in peacetime.
Which makes sense—if I know where you live, you know where I live, neither of
us is going anywhere any time soon, and we’re not at war with each other, why
bother being so pedantic (not to mention un-neighbourly) about up-front
payments? Coinage, on the other hand, is important if there’s some marauding
army passing through, you don’t trust the other party one bit, and would
rather sooner have nothing more to do with the other. Graeber dubs this the
<em>military-slavery-coinage complex</em>.</p>

<p id="paragraph-7">This complex started in what he dubs <em>the Axial Age</em>—the same age in which
Pythagoras, the Buddha, and Confucius were contemporaries (circa 500 <span class="small-caps">BC</span>), and the major world philosophies/religions arose, in response to this
great rending of social relations due to incessant warfare.</p>

<p id="paragraph-8"><em>Interest—usury—was banned</em> / considered immoral under most / all of these
philosophies.</p>

<p id="paragraph-9"><em>The Muslim traders</em> were actually the first ones famous for setting up trading
outposts all out across the Indian Ocean, and had somehow all managed to agree
to keep their wars to dry land, reserving the seas for peaceful commerce.<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-1" class="sidenote">Which explains my own long-standing question about the origins of
Islamic cultures in South-east Asian communities. They don’t teach you much
about this in Singapore, despite having what they like to call a “world-class
education system”.</span></p>

<p id="paragraph-10"><em>The colonization of the Americas,</em> specifically the enslavement of Native
Americans in the American gold and silver mines, wouldn’t have been so
profitable were it not for the then insatiable appetite of the dynamic Chinese
market for bullion, and the demand for “eastern luxuries” in (the rich parts
of) Europe. (In fact, prices for silver collapsed in Europe around that time
from over-supply.) Eventually, though, they got tired of having to export so
much bullion that they started the Opium War to try and settle that balance of
payments.</p>

<p id="paragraph-11"><em>Your 401K</em> (or equivalent retirement account invested in <span class="small-caps">US</span> government
bonds)? That’s basically you financing <span class="small-caps">US</span> government debt, above and
on top of what you already pay in taxes. And so where does the money come from
to finance the interest on those government loans? ;)</p>
