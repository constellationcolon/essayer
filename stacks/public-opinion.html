<div id="author"><span>Lippmann, Walter</span></div>

<div class="main-text">

<p id="paragraph-0">It’s easy to see why Walter Lippmann gets slammed for flagrant elitism.</p>

<p id="paragraph-1">To be sure, <em>Public Opinion</em> is one momentous book; which other can claim to
not only have coined the term <span class="small-caps">stereotype</span>, but also the phrase <span class="small-caps">the manufacture of consent</span><sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-1" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-1" class="sidenote">Referenced variously by <a class="citation" href="#engineering-consent">Bernays, 1955</a>, <a class="citation" href="#manufacturing-consent">Herman &amp; Chomsky, 1988</a>, <a class="citation" href="#engineering-public">Tufekci, 2014</a>, amongst others.</span>? With fortuitous
beginnings he points out that we who live in societies with spheres of
influence beyond the direct experience of our 5 senses, must inevitably act on
and react to a <em>mediated</em> reality, to representations of fickle fidelity to
the situation on the ground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-2">Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its interests
and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens,
ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp.
<a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">Lippmann, 1922, chap. 3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-3">If the situation he wrote of in 1922 seems strangely familiar to our
post-2016, filter bubble consciousness, it is probably because the situation
has not improved in the slightest (read: it’s worse). To situate ourselves a
little in time, 1922 was right about when the <span class="small-caps">TV</span> was busy getting
invented, but it wasn’t really until the world had limped through two world
wars that the average family had a <span class="small-caps">TV</span> set in their home.</p>

<p id="paragraph-4">So imagine yourself as Lippmann, having ‘gone to school in Boston’, already
writing about such mediation difficulties in an era with just the
(comparatively) staid daily newspaper. No chattering talking heads yakking
their heads off in a box, no frenzied twittering, tiktoking, or For You Feeds,
no sir. Yet administrators were already finding themselves inundated by the
cacophony of the world whose affairs they were in charge of arranging. As for
the average person—citing James Melvin Lee in <em>The History of American
Journalism</em>, “the subject of deepest interest to an average human being is
himself; next to that he is most concerned about his neighbors.” So to this
complicated task of governance over “The Great Society”, Lippmann prescribed
the guidance of experts. Specifically, technical experts, since it was by
“exact measurements and quantitative analysis” that the colossus had grown, and
hence it must be by such “technic” that the colossus be brought under control.
Not all such experts, though, were created equal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-5">Yet curiously enough, though he knew that he needed help, he was slow to
call in the social scientist. The chemist, the physicist, the geologist, had
a much earlier and more friendly reception. Laboratories were set up for
them, inducements offered, for there was quick appreciation of the victories
over nature. But the scientist who has human nature as his problem is in a
different case. There are many reasons for this: the chief one, that he has
so few victories to exhibit. He has so few, because unless he deals with the
historic past, he cannot prove his theories before offering them to the
public. The physical scientist can make an hypothesis, test it, revise the
hypothesis hundreds of times, and, if after all that, he is wrong, no one
else has to pay the price. But the social scientist cannot begin to offer
the assurance of a laboratory test, and if his advice is followed, and he is
wrong, the consequences may be incalculable. He is in the nature of things
far more responsible, and far less certain.<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-2" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-2" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-2" class="sidenote">Just to underscore
the point here—it is not so much that the physical scientist is that much
smarter or more capable than the social scientist, it’s that their field of
study is just simpler and more predictable than the study of human
beings—much less the study of human beings in large groups interacting. Drop
a physical scientist into a  non-vacuum, and they are wont to do just as
badly (<a href="bullshit-jobs.html#physicists">or worse, make shit up</a>).
</span><a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">Lippmann, 1922, chap. 25</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-6">Almost by definition, the “technical expert” who is the best candidate for
bringing the thronging masses under control would be the social scientist. But
nothing is certain for human beings outside of birth, death—and some say
taxes. Humans behave in ways quite unlike the predictable movements of the
planets, or the precise enthalpy of vaporisation of water. Even more
troublesome, it is not, generally speaking, socially acceptable to experiment
on human beings as one does on an inert rock, or an insentient mouse<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-3" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-3" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-3" class="sidenote">Not that that has <a href="https://w.wiki/gEU">stopped</a> <a href="https://www.improbable.com/2015/03/22/ig-nobel-prize-winner-lee-kuan-yew-dies-in-singapore/">people</a>
<a href="https://www.improbable.com/2020/10/02/ig-nobel-medical-education-prize-winner-continues-his-lesson/">trying</a></span>. But even in the face of these difficulties,
Lippmann believes that the social scientist will come into their own when they
find their reproducible method—starting with wresting control of the data
collection process from the administrator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="paragraph-7">[…] The physical scientists achieved their freedom from clericalism by
working out a method that produced conclusions of a sort that could not be
suppressed or ignored. They convinced themselves and acquired dignity, and
knew what they were fighting for. The social scientist will acquire his
dignity and his strength when he has worked out his method. He will do that
by turning into opportunity the need among directing men of the Great Society
for instruments of analysis by which an invisible and most stupendously
difficult environment can be made intelligible.</p>

  <p id="paragraph-8">[…] To-day the sequence is that the man of affairs finds his facts, and
decides on the basis of them; then, some time later, the social scientist
deduces excellent reasons why he did or did not decide wisely. This ex post
facto relationship is academic in the bad sense of that fine word. The real 
sequence should be one where the disinterested expert first finds and 
formulates the facts for the man of action, and later makes what wisdom he 
can out of comparison between the decision, which he understands, and the 
facts, which he organized. <a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">Lippmann, 1922, chap. 25</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="paragraph-9">If there exists such a monstrous thing as the disinterested expert in this
world, I should very much like to meet them. How, in the first place, does one
get to become an expert in a subject area if they weren’t particularly
interested in it at all? Humans are always interested parties, even
if—<em>especially</em> if they interject themselves as an apparently neutral third
party in an affair. There is no such thing in this world as an unbiased view,
or an objective set of facts about the social world, especially if, as Lippmann
is recommending here, they were “organized” by a single person with all the
limitations of their own life’s experiences, the filter bubble of their class
and status. <!-- TK: rant on neutrality --></p>

<p id="paragraph-10">In any case, people certainly aren’t waiting around for the ‘experts’ to ride
to their rescue.<sup><label for="toggle-sidenote-4" class="sidenote-number"></label></sup><input id="toggle-sidenote-4" class="sidenote-toggle" type="checkbox"><span id="sidenote-4" class="sidenote">The entirety of 2016 is illustrative: Brexit,
Trump… need I say more?</span> After all, it is the deified
economists of the Chicago School who have so freely marketed the American
economy right into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/poverty-and-inequality-under-trump-human-rights-under-threat">yawning maw of inequality</a> it is now in.</p>
