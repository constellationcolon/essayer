The online news ecosystem has, up until very recently, been funded
predominantly by advertising. For decades, broadcast & print mass media
companies had enjoyed the undivided attention of the popular mind, and the
undivided financial support of the advertisers.[^me]

<!-- TK: what happened in between? -->

It seemed one day we were inking our fingers and smudging our cheeks with grey
newsprint, and the very next, our eyes were glued to our pocket computers,
captives in the walled gardens of the Books of Faces. 

But insofar as journalists have dutifully written up (rightly) critical
thinkpieces on the impacts that tech is having on our attention spans and our
mental health[^jmt], as much as they have (also rightly)
bemoaned the ill-gotten gains of the tech behemoths, engorged on the
appropriated labour of those engaged in the real work of newsgathering, much
of this discourse has also been in reminiscence of the mythical halcyon days,
when a strong, free press could "speak truth to power" <!-- TK: [citation
needed] --> à la [*All the President's Men*](#fn:bernstein)[^bernstein].

What the *New York Times* doesn't tell you, when it propagates its
[*Truth*](#fn:nyt)[^nyt]; what the op-eds don't say, when they opine that ["You
Are the
Product"](https://theconversation.com/if-its-free-online-you-are-the-product-95182)
of the social networks, is that the mass media in crisis today was *itself*
built on selling you, the consumer, as a product to the advertiser[^tdp]. Not
only were you already the product, the mass media's claims to "truth" and
"objectivity" were instituted not so much on the grounds of some noble sense of
journalistic integrity, but more so out of fear of upsetting the paying
advertiser[^thompson]. <!-- TK: page ref from talese --> As soon as the
newspaper started to derive most of its revenue from the advertiser and not
from you, the reader, it had already been defanged as a speaker of the people's
truth.

<div class="section-break">&</div>

It's a bit of a mystery how we came to use the word *default* to mean <span
class="sc">the standard fall-back option in the absence of an explicitly
declared choice</span>. But one can certainly *guess*; its Latin roots, *de*
'away' + *fallo* 'deceive, cheat, escape notice of', point their spindly
fingers at a slippery swindler. With its older senses, we speak of failure, of
negligence, in meeting any of a variety of obligations: failing to make
payments, we default on a loan; failing to show up, we default a game, or a
court summons.

When we think of defaults today--factory defaults, default search engines,
default home-pages, we think first and foremost of their pre-set nature. Yet,
buried underneath all those dusty menus full of configurable and untouched
options lies the Default, that abdication of our responsibility as human
operators to specify an instruction for the machine.

The unflattering denotation of the default was probably not lost on early
designers of computer systems. Bruce Tognazzini, writing design guidelines for
the Apple *IIe*[^meyers], for instance, opens the section on 'Defaults' (p. 37)
thus:

> Please do not ever use the word default in a program designed for humans.
> Default is something the mortgage went into right before the evil banker
> stole the Widow Parson's house. There is an exhaustive list of substitutes
> (previous, automatic, standard, etc.) in the Appendix to How to Write a 
> Manual.
>
> Defaults should be declared, not assumed. Undeclared (not displayed) defaults
> such as pressing `RETURN` for Yes (or for No?) will cause confusion and
> anger.

(Bruce is probably out there somewhere today, squirming with confusion and
anger.)

Such a failure can sometimes be a good thing for wider society—for the organ
donor's registry, for example, even if controversial. But it is especially A
Very Good Thing for the ponderous tech giant attempting to break into a new
market: in the case of the First Browser War, the death knell sounded for
Netscape when Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer into Windows, effectively
making IE the default, and hence the browser of (lazy consumer) choice. Why
bother developing a better product when you can just tack it on to your
already-popular platform, and make all your pre-existing users adopt it?[^ft]
