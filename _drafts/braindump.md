cern: smashing particles together to find out what they're made of

smashing clocks together to discern their inner workings

nlp, bag of words: tokenising our narratives and expositions to ???

reification of (generative) art

semantic drain and the meaninglessness of modern work / plastic words /
orwell: the english language

{% cite spell-of-the-sensuous %} cf The Flesh of Language.

advertising / marketing:
tech companies: like a magpie or hermit crab collecting trinkets to pretend to
"unicorn status"
humans: consumption as social identity

plastic words being an apt metaphor in light of the plastic pollution we're
suffering from: easily mass produced, consumed en masse, and discarded en masse
without thoughtâ€”but ultimately toxic for life

plastic being the stand-in for the real thing (fake plastic trees)

that generated post-modern essay that was accepted for publication

architecture: brutalism, disproportion

unidimensional scaling: extremely simplified model for study
left-right characterisation + polarisation
inadequacy of model as perpetuated by mass media -> shock of trump, brexit
e.g. https://www.paulkingsnorth.net/global
sometimes, it's as if the people conducting the studies have forgotten that
these are models of reality, not messy reality itself

models of reality BECOMING part of social reality itself
(BECAUSE all social reality is constructed)
this is not something that happens to "natural sciences": an anvil falling
from the tower of pisa isn't going to change course just because your theory
about it is a certain way
