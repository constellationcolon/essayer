title:      Boundary Conditions
---

In the arcane art of solving a differential equation, knowing the laws
governing the evolution of the system under consideration is half the game.
The other half consists of knowing the _boundary conditions_ of the system,
which can change the solution just as drastically as what goes on within its
boundaries. In the broader context of mathematical reasoning, Gödel's
incompleteness tells us that the set of truths that are provable within an
axiomatic system are more or less completely dependent on the _axioms_ one
accepts as its foundations—and that no axiomatic system can demonstrate its
own consistency. In other words, axioms must always be determined according to
external arguments, and there is no way of proving, using the system itself,
that these are the "correct" axioms to use in the first place. Others might
call it the _prime mover_—that which moves without being moved (Aristotle),
the _categorical imperative_—that law which can be justified as an end onto
itself (Kant), or that place to stand from where they might operate their
lever long enough to move the world (Archimedes).
