The online news ecosystem has, up until very recently, been funded
predominantly by advertising. For decades, broadcast & print mass media
companies had enjoyed the undivided attention of the popular mind, and the
undivided financial support of the advertisers. 

<!-- TK: what happened in between? -->

For decades, mass media companies had enjoyed the undivided attention of the
popular mind. The larger the circulation of a paper, the more a print
publication was able to charge for a spot between its sheets. Circulation was
king. The lifestyle section and the Sunday paper were just two of the
"innovations" that publications came up with in their drive to reach ever
widening audiences and demographics—to women, especially, who were known as the
ones to actually go out and spend money on the wares the advertisers were
hawking.

All this, obviously, changed with the internet. At first, the internet was just
this dinky little thing that everyone would just put their articles up on for
free, a [technological curiosity obsessed over by the IT nerds in the
basement](https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/word-up-this-is-the-story-behind-the-new-york-times-most-famous-tweet-which-is-10-years-old-today/).

It seemed one day we were inking our fingers and smudging our cheeks with grey
newsprint, and the very next, our eyes were glued to our pocket computers,
captives in the walled gardens of the Books of Faces. 

But insofar as journalists have dutifully written up (rightly) critical
thinkpieces on the impacts that tech is having on our attention spans and our
mental health[^jmt], as much as they have (also rightly)
bemoaned the ill-gotten gains of the tech behemoths, engorged on the
appropriated labour of those engaged in the real work of newsgathering, much
of this discourse has also been in reminiscence of the mythical halcyon days,
when a strong, free press could "speak truth to power" <!-- TK: [citation

What the *New York Times* doesn't tell you, when it propagates its
[*Truth*](https://www.nytco.com/press/nytimes-releases-new-ads-from-the-truth-is-hard-campaign-directed-by-darren-aronofsky/); what the op-eds don't say, when they opine that ["You
Are the
Product"](https://theconversation.com/if-its-free-online-you-are-the-product-95182)
of the social networks, is that the mass media in crisis today was *itself*
built on selling you, the consumer, as a product
[^wiki-television-delivers-people] to the advertiser.
Not only were you already the product, the mass media's claims to "truth" and
"objectivity" were instituted not so much on the grounds of some noble sense of
journalistic integrity, but more so out of fear of upsetting the paying
advertiser[^media-future-past]. <!-- TK: page ref from talese --> As soon as the
newspaper started to derive most of its revenue from the advertiser and not
from you, the reader, it had already been defanged as a speaker of the people's
truth.

Much like the way that we are (not) dealing with any of our many chronic crises
just now coming to a head,

    AFAIK, this short video is the first time that the phrase, "you are the
    product" gets applied to a form of media. Although the video refers
    explicitly to TV, the same analysis can certainly apply to any form of
    media that is (nearly) free to consume—including the newspaper.
