Or as the English may have it, "Why Try?"

They tell you, when you read Montaigne's _Essais_, that "essayer" means "to
attempt", or "to test" in its native French.[^1] The _essay_, then a freshly
minted format in the Western canon, was meant to be a piece of writing
primarily for exploring ideas, rather than for the sake of argument, or for the
sake of exposition.

400 years after Montaigne, git was born[^2], and with it, gave us a whole new
way of writing, collaborating, and blaming other people for bad code only to
find out definitively that it was your own damned self from one year ago all
along.

And in some ways, those are the exact purposes of written discourse—to assert,
to exchange ideas, and to blame others for logical fallacies all up until the
point that you discover you'd laid those mental traps for yourself in the first
place. It's a medium for extraversion and introspection alike.

There's this article, years gone, that still comes to mind. I can't remember
what it was called, or what its subject was,[^3] but I do remember that it was
presented as if it were a word document on edit mode, laying bare every word
misspelled and then corrected, every paragraph typed up and subsequently
discarded, even whole themes developed and subsequently abandoned on the way to
producing the final opus. Kill your darlings indeed. Kill them dead.

In that particular incarnation, the article turned out to be a beast to read,
with all its green fields of newly sprouted words, its boundless grey oceans
of stricken-out text in between the solid black shorelines of black type that'd
made the final cut. But the idea stuck, that even (especially?) those that
write for a living will only get the words to come out right on a second,
third, or even a hundredth try—whittling down the verbiage, sharpening up the
propositions each time they revisit it.

Not very far apart, I've found, from what I do in my day job. In code, what
writers call "editing", we call "refactoring": rebuilding our instructions for
the machines little by little as we learn about the problems we're trying to
solve through the very process of solving them. Tidying up the plot, so to
speak. Trimming the fat, but keeping the scraps, just in case they come in
useful later on. Also helpful for being honest with yourself: human
endeavours are never borne of immaculate conception.

    they _don't_ bother telling you that when you read it as a French person.

[^2]: TIL this fortuitous event took place as recently as 2005. Now 15 years
    later I am committing this to digital memory via a company that does nothing
    _but_ git. Yes, I know that SVN et al existed before that, but you're also
    reading this on GitHub, not SVNHub.

[^3]: If you, dear reader, do remember such a thing floating around the
    internet, please do point me to it, will you?
