  - not all complaints: youth, use your energy and imagination
  - "Tyrrell: One thing that strikes me about the type of society that we have
    now is how difficult it has become to think of other ways of being human or
    developing. Students today, for example, are sort of pulled into
    consumerism because they are lumbered with huge debts from the day they
    enter university. It used to be thought that young people need a period of
    time in their life to look at other ideas and philosophies and thoughts,
    and meet with people from other backgrounds and with different interests
    and that they should be allowed to change direction if inspired to do so,
    changing a degree subject in midstream, perhaps. And this was considered
    OK. But now being consumers of education and the pressure of having to pay
    off those debts is actually making it harder for students."
    "Curtis: It seems to me that consumerism is a way of managing human beings
    as much as it is a way of selling them things. The roots of it lie very
    explicitly back in the 1920s. We have forgotten this but it grew out of an
    ideological idea about managing the masses at a time when democracy was
    emerging. Back then they argued about controlling in a totalitarian way,
    fascist or communist. But another way to control people was found â€”
    through consumerism."

  - "higher education" as intergenerational/interclass transfer of wealth,
    from young to old university administrators
  - de beauvoir points out that in the male-dominated western canon, the blame
    usually falls on the mother for "immanence" (tying people down to the
    masses, to animal nature), even though paradoxically, the "sowing of the
    seeds" (the active element) is attributed to the father
