birth, death, taxes.

"innovation", "recurring revenue", ...: we live and die and regenerate and have
to re-acquire sustenance everyday, the 'boundary conditions' for our lives.

"trickle down": insidious, inaccurate metaphor, but characterises well the
recurring nature of our needs, so long as we're alive

“Like most conversations and most chess games, we all start off the same and we
all end the same, with a brief moment of difference in between. Fertilization
to fertilizer. Ashes to ashes. And we spark across the gap.” — The Most Human
Human, Brian Christian

"the denial of death"

homo sapiens: periodic boundary conditions?

death as necessity
- physicist quote

asking the right questions

creativity
  - iambic pentameter
  - blank slate is toughest, having constraints makes creativity easier

perversely, censorship also helps

    > “Martin Esslin, a scholar and my professor, used to say that in Eastern
      Europe under communism, everything was read as political. … There was so
      much vibrancy to the theatre. After the Berlin Wall fell, theatre was
      much less interesting,” said Claudia Orenstein, professor and chair of
      Hunter College’s theatre department. “Now people will see completely
      different plays than they saw before.”

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall
move the world." -- Aristotle
- much has been said about the length of the lever, not so much about the
  fixed fulcrum: need "axioms" / "material conditions" / foundation, or
  whatever you want to call it to be able to apply your force against.

make models of the world precisely because we've found that there are
regularities in our environment, persistent through time, that we can exploit
to get what we need. this is the fulcrum.

shock doctrine: remove the fulcrum. people have no basis of fact, no way to
know that conditions in the world will still be the same tomorrow such that
taking some action today would still be beneficial.

So long as AI doesn't share the same BC's as humans, they will never be truly
"intelligent" in all the senses of the word that humans have it. And if they
share the same BC's--birth and death and taxes, and then, love and loss,
euphoria and grief, and vanity and imperfection and hubris and everything
in-between? Well then at that point, we may as well have just brought a new
child into the world the way that evolution has ________ us after having
tinkered with Homo sapiens for a couple billion years instead of going to all
the trouble of trying to invent one from scratch.
