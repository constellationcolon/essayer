birth, death, taxes.

"innovation", "recurring revenue", ...: we live and die and regenerate and have
to re-acquire sustenance everyday, the 'boundary conditions' for our lives.

"trickle down": insidious, inaccurate metaphor, but characterises well the
recurring nature of our needs, so long as we're alive

“Like most conversations and most chess games, we all start off the same and we
all end the same, with a brief moment of difference in between. Fertilization
to fertilizer. Ashes to ashes. And we spark across the gap.” — The Most Human
Human, Brian Christian

"the denial of death"

homo sapiens: periodic boundary conditions?

death as necessity

asking the right questions

creativity
  - iambic pentameter

    > “Martin Esslin, a scholar and my professor, used to say that in Eastern
      Europe under communism, everything was read as political. … There was so
      much vibrancy to the theatre. After the Berlin Wall fell, theatre was
      much less interesting,” said Claudia Orenstein, professor and chair of
      Hunter College’s theatre department. “Now people will see completely
      different plays than they saw before.”

So long as AI doesn't share the same BC's as humans, they will never be truly
"intelligent" in all the senses of the word that humans have it. And if they
share the same BC's--birth and death and taxes, and then, love and loss,
euphoria and grief, and vanity and imperfection and hubris and everything
in-between? Well then at that point, we may as well have just brought a new
child into the world the way that evolution has ________ us after having
tinkered with Homo sapiens for a couple billion years instead of going to all
the trouble of trying to invent one from scratch.
