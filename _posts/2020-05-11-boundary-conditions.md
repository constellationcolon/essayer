birth, death, taxes.

"Only money that goes out of date like a newspaper, rots like potatoes, rusts
like iron, evaporates like ether, is capable of standing the test as an
instrument for the exchange of potatoes, newspapers, iron and ether. For such
money is not preferred to goods either by the purchaser or the seller. We then
part with our goods for money only because we need the money as a means of
exchange, not because we expect an advantage from possession of the money. So
we must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a
medium of exchange."
— Silvio Gesell, "The Natural Economic Order"

"innovation", "recurring revenue", ...: we live and die and regenerate and have
to re-acquire sustenance everyday, the 'boundary conditions' for our lives.

"trickle down": insidious, inaccurate metaphor, but characterises well the
recurring nature of our needs, so long as we're alive

“Like most conversations and most chess games, we all start off the same and we
all end the same, with a brief moment of difference in between. Fertilization
to fertilizer. Ashes to ashes. And we spark across the gap.” — The Most Human
Human, Brian Christian

homo sapiens: periodic boundary conditions via reproduction?

## death as our enemy, death as our friend

A new scientific truth does not generally triumph by persuading its opponents
and getting them to admit their errors, but rather by its opponents gradually
dying out and giving way to a new generation that is raised on it. … An
important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over
and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What
does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing
generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance
of the fact that the future lies with the youth.

asking the right questions

creativity
  - iambic pentameter
  - blank slate is toughest, having constraints makes creativity easier

perversely, censorship also helps

    > “Martin Esslin, a scholar and my professor, used to say that in Eastern
      Europe under communism, everything was read as political. … There was so
      much vibrancy to the theatre. After the Berlin Wall fell, theatre was
      much less interesting,” said Claudia Orenstein, professor and chair of
      Hunter College’s theatre department. “Now people will see completely
      different plays than they saw before.”

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall
move the world." -- Aristotle
- much has been said about the length of the lever, not so much about the
  fixed fulcrum: need "axioms" / "material conditions" / foundation, or
  whatever you want to call it to be able to apply your force against.

make models of the world precisely because we've found that there are
regularities in our environment, persistent through time, that we can exploit
to get what we need. this is the fulcrum.

shock doctrine: remove the fulcrum. people have no basis of fact, no way to
know that conditions in the world will still be the same tomorrow such that
taking some action today would still be beneficial.

So long as AI doesn't share the same BC's as humans, they will never be truly
"intelligent" in all the senses of the word that humans have it. And if they
share the same BC's--birth and death and taxes, and then, love and loss,
euphoria and grief, and vanity and imperfection and hubris and everything
in-between? Well then at that point, we may as well have just brought a new
child into the world the way that evolution has shaped us after having
tinkered with Homo sapiens for a couple billion years instead of going to all
the trouble of trying to invent one from scratch.


=> remodelling our ideals and institutions to hew more closely to human
boundary conditions (NB: this != reflect current realities, only need to
reflect inevitabilities) instead of simply building castles in thin air.

e.g. current fetish of unlimited growth on a finite planet with finite
resources, or SG placing emphasis on growth decade after decade on a tiny
island being threatened by sea-level rise.

either
1.  accept that resources are finite and come up with new ideals that are more
    compatible with all the other bio- and geo-diversity on Earth
2.  reject earthly limitations (e.g. escape to Mars or something à la all the
    Silicon Valley bros) and eventually loop back around to insatiable greed
    and environmental degradation everywhere we live, leaving behind a Mad Max
    legacy on the planet we started from (cf Exogenesis by Muse)
