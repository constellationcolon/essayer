title:    "Propaganda"
---

IF prostitution is the world's oldest profession, surely then propaganda must
be the world's oldest industry. After all, the birds and the bees are
predicated on its wiles: it's not for the pleasures of music that the songbird
trills, not for the aesthetics of landscape that the flowers bloom. As soon as
sexual reproduction appeared on the scene, organisms have needed to advertise
their sexual availability, to potential mates and pollinators alike.

propaganda -> advertising after ww2


  - advertising as the world's oldest industry? the ad-men predate prostitutes
    even [citation needed: prostitution in apes; any older?]. certainly with
    sexual reproduction came the need to advertise sexual availability, before
    animals figured out they could barter sex.
  - have to advertise to stand out in a crowded market (generating demand where
    previously there was none, i.e. nobody saw a need for it, or wanted it in
    the first place)
  - somewhere along the way people accepted that lie/adverts as truth at
    face-value (observation collapses the wave function? observation changes
    the result? or was that true from the start?)
  - something about plato vs aristotle??
  - no logo: unfettered from earthly goods & assets, trade on ideas & brands
    (attempting to extricate oneself from the human boundary condition, only
    everyone is still tied down)
  - value of "essential work" vs value of "non-essential work" (COVID-19)
  - value of "woman's work" vs value of "non-woman's work"
    - russia doctors anecdote
  - commodity fetishism -> brand fetishism
  - unfortunately, human brains seem to work just via passive absorption on
    some level: see/hear something more => seems more true

  - hollywood + cultural dominance + consumerism + propaganda
  - panem et circensus / soma
  - persuasion by diffusion, or why i have a hard time reading a lot of fiction
    / watching shows (tv/movie) these days
  - "Bernays, particularly after the rise and fall of the Third Reich (Goebbels
    was an assiduous student of his methods), thought that the safest way of
    maintaining democracy was to distract people from dangerous political
    thought by letting them think that their real choices were as consumers."
    "In proving this, and in showing, as Bernays predicted and helped to 
    engineer, how American and British democracy has evolved from supporting a
    liberal elite which told you what was good for you, to supporting another,
    market oriented elite, which keeps you in check by constantly giving you
    the things you feel you want, Curtis, however, found himself presented
    with a problem."
    "In this respect, the genie of the Self has already escaped the bottle.
    One logical conclusion of Curtis's argument is that business will
    eventually take over the functions of government, since it is much better,
    more effective, at simply satisfying people's desires than any politician
    ever was."
    "In an interview when he was 100, the father of public relations allowed
    that he may have created something of a monster.

    'Everyone has a press agent now,' he said, 'or a media consultant or
    communications director or whatever you want to call it. Sometimes,' he
    suggested, 'it seems sort of like having discovered a medicine to cure a
    disease, and then finding out that so much of it is being administered that
    people are getting sick from the overdoses.'"

    while, it doesn't work anymore" -- naomi klein (?)
  - lifestyle marketing
    - Curtis: "lifestyle" marketing from lucrative exploitation of Freudian
      theories about the irrational, subconscious self. manufacturers worried
      that people would stop buying once they got what they needed (demand-side)

    - Klein: "lifestyle" marketing because competing on basis of superior
      products wasn't profitable any longer => get rid of physical assets &
      factories & costly full-time workers, focus on brand and design and
      marketing that don't carry "physical costs" with them (supply-side)
